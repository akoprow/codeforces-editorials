DFS.  Suppose we're at node $$u$$ and $$c_u = v$$ and the node has $$n$$ children.  First we number those children from $$1$$ to $$n$$.  Then we assign $$v+1$$ to that node (so it'll have $$v$$ smaller values below) and also note that all numbers in the subtree that are greater equal than $$v+1$$ will need to be bumped by one.

Then we do a second DFS to bump numbers as prescribed.
