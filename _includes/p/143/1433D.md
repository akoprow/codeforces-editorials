It's pretty clear that if all districts are ruled by a single gang then the answer is NO.  Otherwise it's YES as we can:

* pick any city at all, say it's ruled by $$x$$,
* connect everything not ruled by $$x$$ to the root and then
* connect all remaining districts run by $$x$$ to any district from the previous step.
