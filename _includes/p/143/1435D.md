Picking shuriken $$x$$ at a given location means that all the others pending locations must have shurikens $$> x$$.  This means the last available slot is least constrained so greedily always allocate next shuriken to latest available position (using a stack to keep track of them).  Then verify that this is a valid solution by using a heap and checking exercise constraints.
