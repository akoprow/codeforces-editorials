Important observation is that $$a \oplus a \oplus b = b$$.  Turns out we can always solve it for an odd-length array.  Just apply it on all positions in steps of twom, which will go from: $$a, b, c, d, e, f, g \to x, x, x, d, e, f, g \to x, x, y, y, y, f, g \to x, x, y, y, z, z, z$$ and now going from the back forward we can easily turn everything into $$z$$.

Now, what if the array is of an even size?  Turns out we can apply the same process to the array without the last element.  If the $$z$$ we obtain is the same as the last array element we're good.  If not, the answer is "NO".

Why?  Well, let's call $$X$$ the xor of all the elements of the original array.  Now, notice that applying the operation does not change it. Xor of an even number of equal elements is always $$0$$ so the answer exists iff $$X = 0$$, in which case the above construction works.
