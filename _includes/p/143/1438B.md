It turns out the answer is "YES" iff there are two identical elements in the array.  Suppose there are; then obviously pick just those two numbers as the segments in question and we are done.  Now suppose all numbers are different; well, then they'll never add up to the same thing as each number sets a different bit in the target sum.
