Keep track of the number of nodes we have at the current level; initially $$1$$.  Each next increasing sequence can be used as children of a single node from the previous level.  Once we attached children to all nodes on the previous level we start a new one (while keeping track how many nodes it will have).  Pretty simple implementation that ends up not using trees at all.
