Firstly two observations: order does not matter and no repetitions so let's just look at it as a sorted set.  Secondly, whatever number Alice chooses it's optimal for Bob to choose next available one.

Now, if, as Alice, we want to choose on a contiguous segment we can do better than that, say we have 3 moves and play on $$(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6)$$.  We can play $$a_3, a_2, a_1$$ so that Bob will pick $$a_4, a_5, a_6$$.  In other words we take the prefix, he takes the suffix.

DP follows, where $$T_{k, i}$$ is the best score with $$k$$ moves playing on numbers up to and including index $$i$$.  For $$T_{k, i}$$ we can either not play at $$i$$, so take $$T_{k,i-1}$$ or we can play a segment ending there.  Let $$s$$ be the length of that segment (we consider all possible options), then we get: $$T_{k,i} = min_s dp_{k-s, i-2*s} + (\sum_{i \in i-s+1..i} a_i)- (\sum_{i \in i-2*s+1..i-s+1} a_i)$$.
