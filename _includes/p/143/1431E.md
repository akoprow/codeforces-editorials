Suppose that players from the first team will loose $$k$$ games, for that it's best to pair worst $$k$$ players from the first team with the best $$k$$ players from the second one and it's best to pair them as $$(a_1, b_{n-k}), (a_2, b_{n-k+1}), \ldots, (a_k, b_n)$$; similarly for the rest.  Now consider all $$k \in [1..n]$$ and pick best.  As it turns out that means that the final solution will be a cyclic shift of an identity permutation.
