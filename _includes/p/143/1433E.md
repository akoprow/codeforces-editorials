Take $$x = \frac{n}{2}$$.  So we have:

* pick who goes in first dance: $$\binom{2x}{x}$$
* pick order of people in a single dance: $$(x-1)!$$ (we divide by $$n$$ because rotations are equivalent)

Altogether: $$\frac{\binom{2x}{x}  (n-1)!^2}{2} = \frac{\binom{2x}{x} (x-1)!^2}{2 * x!^2} = \frac{(2x)!}{2x^2} = \frac{(2x-1)!}{x}$$
