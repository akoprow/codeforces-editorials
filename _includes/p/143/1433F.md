Interesting problem.  Notice that all numbers all pretty small.  Then notice that for each row the only thing we care about is what's the maximum sum we can pick from this row for every possible remainder modulo $$k$$ in $$[0, k)$$.  Having that we can simply combine two rows by considering all pairs of entries.

For a single row we can compute it with DP where $$S_{i, r}$$ is the maximal sum we can obtain from combining $$i$$ numbers obtaining a sum that has reminder $$r$$ modulo $$k$$.  Then we iterate over numbers in the row and progressively update $$S$$.
