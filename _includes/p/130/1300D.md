Hand-wave'y: the answer is true iff the polygon has central symmetry.  To check whether a polygon has central symmetry we need:

- the number of its points to be even,
- take all their segments: $$p_0$$ to $$p_n$$, $$p_1$$ to $$p_{n+1}$$ etc. and their middles must coincide (that point will be the centre of symmetry).

`TODO`: provide a less hand-wave'y explanation.
