Clearly any $$0$$ will lead to the product being $$0$$ so we need to bump all of them up to $$1$$.  After that if the sum is non-zero we're done and if it is zero we sill need to bump any positive number once; and such a number must exist since the sum is $$0$$ and none of the elements is $$0$$ (any more).
