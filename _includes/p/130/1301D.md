Nice construction!  First observe that it's always possible to take all roads.  So if $$k$$ is less or equal number of roads it's enough to construct a solution.  Possible construction is:

* go fully $$R$$ and back $$L$$ for the first row
* for all subsequence rows repeat: $$R, U, D$$ and then come back $$L$$
* finally go all the way back $$U$$

Careful to not do more steps than necessary!
