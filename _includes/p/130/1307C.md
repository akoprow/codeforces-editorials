The crucial observation is that we can restrict ourselves to looking for $$1$$ and $$2$$ lettered secret messages only.  Why?  Suppose the secret message occurs $$x$$ times and has more than two letters.  Then the secret message consisting of its two characters prefix will occur at least $$x$$ times as every longer message maps to a shorter one.

For one character messages we simply count all the letters and pick the most frequent one.

For two character messages we keep a frequency count for $$1$$ and $$2$$ characters long combinations and the updates are fairly straightforward.
