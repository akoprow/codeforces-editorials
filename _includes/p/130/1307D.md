With a simple BFS let's compute the distances from source/target to all the other nodes, let's call them $$s_i$$ and $$t_i$$, respectively.

Firstly, clearly if there is already an edge between two special nodes then let's just use that without affecting the existing length from source to target at all.

Otherwise, note that by connecting two special nodes $$i$$ to $$j$$ we create a new path from source to target of length: $$min(s_i+t_j, s_j+t_i)+1$$; our goal is to maximize that value.  Without loss of generality let's assume that we have: $$s_i+t_j \le s_j+t_i$$, or, equivalently, $$s_i - t_i \le s_i - t_j$$.  Let's introduce $$D_i = s_i - t_i$$ and let's sort all special nodes by $$D_i$$.  So now we can pick any nodes $$i$$ and $$j$$, such that $$i < j$$ and we're maximizing $$s_i + t_j$$.  We can do that by scanning over all the options for $$j$$ and picking the best $$i < j$$ with maximal $$s_i$$ in $$O(1)$$ via prefix max.
