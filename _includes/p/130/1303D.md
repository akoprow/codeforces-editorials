We can always divide boxes all the way down to size $$1$$ which means that for the answer to exist it is enough if $$\sum_i a_i \ge n$$.

We will do it by iterating over bits in $$n$$ additionally keeping a running sum of all the smaller boxes $$\mathcal{S}$$.  I.e. if we're considering bit $$i$$, $$\mathcal{S}$$ will have a sum of all the boxes of sizes smaller than $$2^i$$ (initially $$\mathcal{S} = 0$$).

When we are considering bit $$i$$ we have the following cases:

- Bit $$i$$ is not set in $$n$$.  In this case we just all the boxes of size $$2^i$$ (if any) to $$\mathcal{S}$$.
- Bit $$i$$ is set and we have a box of size $$2^i$$.  Use that box; if there are any extra boxes of that size add them to $$\mathcal{S}$$.
- Bit $$i$$ is set, we don't have a box of size $$2^i$$ but $$\mathcal{S} \ge 2^i$$.  In this case we can use those smaller boxes and update $$\mathcal{S} := \mathcal{S} - 2^i$$.
- Otherwise, let's take the smallest box we have of size $$2^j$$ ($$j > i$$).  In this case we will divide it all the way down to size $$2^i$$.  At the end of all those divisions we will have two boxes of size $$2^i$$ but we will use one of them immediately so we're left with one copy of a box of the sizes: $$2^{j-1}, 2^{j-2}, \ldots, 2^i$$ and we continue with this new set of boxes.
