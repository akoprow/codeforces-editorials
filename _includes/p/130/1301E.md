Ok, firstly we want for each cell to compute the largest logo whose __red__ bottom-right corned ends at this cell.  This coordinate system is crucial because we want to make sure that if we can construct logo of size $$v$$ at that location we also can do that for all values smaller than $$v$$.

To compute that we use 2d prefix sums (one per color) + binary search.

Once we have that for each query we find the maximal size of the logo within that query.  We once again use binary search + 2d-range max-queries (using 2d Fenwick).
