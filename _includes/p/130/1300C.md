Firstly let's try to understand what the function does.  Essentially $$f(x, y) = (x \mid y) - y = x \& \neg y$$.  We can see that for a bit to be in the answer it must be in $$x$$ (so that it is in $$x \mid y$$) and cannot be in $$y$$ (so that it's not "subtracted" away).

This also means that $$f(x_1, x_2 \ldots x_n) = x_1 \& \neg x_2 \& \ldots \& \neg x_n$$ so effectively the only thing that matters is what's the first element.  So for a bit to be in the answer it needs to be in that first element and in no other.  We want to maximize the answer so let's pick as high as possible bit that is present in only one element and put that element first.
