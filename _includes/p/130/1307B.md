The answer is $$1$$ if and only if $$d$$ is among favourite numbers.

Otherwise the answer is $$max(2, \lceil \frac{d}{max_i a_i} \rceil)$$, i.e. we take the longest distance we can use and we have two options:

- either it's larger than $$d$$ in which case the answer is $$2$$ as we go $$(0, 0) \to (\frac{d}{2}, y) \to (\frac{d}{2}, 0)$$ with an appropriately chosen $$y$$ or
- it's smaller than $$d$$ in which case we keep on hopping directly to the right by that distance and only in the last two steps do a "correction" similar to the one described in the previous bullet.
