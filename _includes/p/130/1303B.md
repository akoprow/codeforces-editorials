Firstly, the answer must be at least $$n$$ (we need to replace the whole highway) and we must have at last $$\DeclareMathOperator{\wantG}{wantG} \wantG = \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$$ good days.  For the second condition we must compute how many full good+bad cycles we need.  We have two cases:

1. $$\wantG \mod g = 0$$, in which case we need $$\frac{\wantG}{g}$$ full cycles but we do not need all the bad days from the last cycle so the final answer is $$\frac{\wantG}{g} \cdot (g + b) - b$$.
2. $$\wantG \mod g > 0$$, in which case we need all the full cycles, plus few extra good days, i.e. the answer is $$\frac{\wantG}{g} \cdot (g + b) + (\wantG \mod g)$$.
