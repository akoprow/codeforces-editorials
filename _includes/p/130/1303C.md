Greedy works, so we can simulate construction of the keyboard by keeping track of the row of letters we have so far and our current position on it.

We start the process by taking the first two letters of the password and placing them next to each other and from then on we have the following options when considering a next letter

- it is already on the keyboard
  - if it is adjacent to our position, just move there,
  - if it is not, we lost.
- it is a new letter
  - if we are currently on either left (or right) end of the keyboard we can extend it to the left (respectively, right) with that letter
  - otherwise, we lost.

If this works for all the letters from the password then all that remains to be done at the end is to add all the remaining letters from the alphabet to either end of the constructed row of letters.
