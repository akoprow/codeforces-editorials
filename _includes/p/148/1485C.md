Let's say that $$\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor = a \mod b = k$$.  How do those pairs look like for $$k=1$$?  We must have $$(v+1, v)$$ as then $$\lfloor \frac{v+1}{v} \rfloor = 1 = (v+1) \mod v$$.  Then for $$2$$ we get: $$(2v+2, v)$$ with $$\lfloor \frac{2v+2}{v} \rfloor = 2 = 2v+2 \mod v$$ etc.

So let's iterate over $$k$$.  For a given $$k$$ we have:

- $$a = kb + k$$,
- $$b > k$$,
- $$1 \le b \le y$$,
- $$a \le x$$.

Substituting $$a$$ in the last equation we get: $$kb + k \le x$$ so we end up with the following constraints on $$b$$:

- $$b \le \frac{x}{k}-1$$ and
- $$k < b \le y$$.

So the number of solutions for a given $$k$$ is: $$max(0, min(y, \frac{x}{k}-1) - k)$$.  And from the fact that smallest $$a$$ is $$k(k+1) + k$$ and $$a \le x$$, we easily get an upper bound of the number of iterations to be $$\sqrt{x}$$.

*Note*: I used a somewhat different reasoning in the live contest and never validated the above via a submission.
