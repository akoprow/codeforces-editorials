For two courses we want to precompute cheapest valid combo of those courses for any choice of the first course.  

How do we combine it for 4 dishes?  Well, let's start with drinks + desserts, for every drink computing the cheapest combo with a dessert. Now that we move to second courses note that we do not care any more which dessert went into the combo.  So let's do second courses + drink/dessert combo, having best option for all three for every second course.  Finally we combine that with first courses and we're done (the code to do it is shorter than this description...).

So we just reduced this problem to two dishes only.  How do we solve that?  Well, let's sort the second dish by increasing price and for every first dish let's go though those options in order stopping at first for which the combo is not forbidden (or concluding there's no option for the given first dish).  Note that the key here is that there are not too many forbidden combos so we know that the total work we'll do is bounded by that, more precisely for $$n$$ options for first dish, $$m$$ for the second and $$f$$ forbidden pairs, one pass costs us $$O(m \log{m} + max(n, f))$$.
