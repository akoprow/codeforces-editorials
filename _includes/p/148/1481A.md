Firstly, all the talk about reordering is a distraction as the order of instructions has no impact on the final coordinate.  Further, observe that we can easily decompose this 2D problem into two 1D problems along both axis.  Let's denote by $$\mathcal{T}_U, \mathcal{T}_D, \mathcal{T}_L, \mathcal{T}_R$$ the total number of steps that we can make in the respective direction (i.e. $$U, D, L, R$$).  The minimal coordinate we can reach along $$X$$ axis is $$-\mathcal{T}_L$$ and that's by keeping all $$L$$ moves and deleting all $$R$$ instructions.  Similarly the maximal is $$R$$.  And we can reach anything in between by deleting some more instructions from those extreme configurations.  So we can reach $$[-\mathcal{T}_L, \mathcal{T}_R]$$ along the $$X$$-axis and $$[-\mathcal{T}_U, \mathcal{T}_D]$$ along the $$Y$$-axis and we just need to check if our target lies within that rectangle.
