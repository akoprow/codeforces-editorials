Now we need to be more efficient as $$2$$ queries per move will not do anymore.

Note how we were wasting some queries in our strategy?  I.e. if both answers were the same, so we asked for $$[l, r]$$ and $$[l, m]$$ (or $$[m, r]$$) and got the same answer then we continue with the $$[l, m]$$ range ($$[m, r]$$) and *don't have to ask for it again*.  The same is not true for the other case, but I thought that we can take advantage of this asymmetry: rather than making both intervals the same, let's make them unequal so that the case where we have to ask twice gains us more.  Unfortunately a) the math does not work out (we still need more than $$20$$ queries) and b) this reasoning is flawed as we *cannot* pick which part the answer will be in and so don't know which segment to make smaller/larger.

Instead the solution is quite simple really.  Let's get the global answer for $$[1, n]$$, say it's $$x$$.  Now let's figure out whether our answer is to the left or to the right of $$x$$, just as we did in `C1`.  Let's say that it's to the right of $$x$$ (the other case being symmetrical).  Note that our answer is simply the *smallest* $$p \in [x+1, n]$$ such that the answer for $$[x, p]$$ is $$x$$.  That's simply because if the global max is not in our range then the globally second element will *not* be the second largest element in the range.
