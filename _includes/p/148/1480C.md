Binary search is the answer.  Our goal is to maintain a segment $$[l, r]$$ such that $$a_{l-1} > a_l$$ and $$a_{r+1} > a_r$$.  Those two boundary conditions ensure that there must be a local minimum within the segment.  We start with $$[1, n]$$, where those inequalities hold "in absentia" (also note that there must be a minimum in $$[1, n]$$ as it contains $$1$$ which is a minimum).

Now how do we perform the step in binary search?  Let's pick $$m$$ in the middle of $$[l, r]$$ as usual.  However, just asking for $$a_m$$ is not enough, we must also ask for $$a_{m+1}$$.  Now we have the following options:

- $$a_{m+1} < a_m$$ in which case we continue with $$[m+1, r]$$, as it clearly fulfils our conditions,
- $$a_m > a_{m+1}$$ and then we continue with $$[l, m]$$.
- we cannot have $$a_m = a_{m+1}$$ as all numbers are distinct in a permutation.
