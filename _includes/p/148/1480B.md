Clearly we need $$\lceil \frac{b_i}{A} \rceil$$ rounds to kill monster $$i$$ and in the process we will sustain $$a_i \cdot \lceil \frac{b_i}{A} \rceil$$ damage.  Our health needs to remain above zero for all, except perhaps the last round.  So let's pick the largest $$a_i$$, i.e. we will leave monster $$i$$ as the last to fight, and check if:

$$B > \sum_i {a_i \cdot \lceil \frac{b_i}{A} \rceil} - \max_i {a_i}$$
