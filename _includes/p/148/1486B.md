Clearly we can decompose this 2D problem into two 1D problems and then just multiply the results.  How do we solve a 1D problem?  Well, the optimal location is always at the median and if there there is an even number of elements than any position between two medians will do.  The intuition for that is clear: there are as many houses to the left as there are to the right so moving left increases the distance by $$1$$ and at the same time, for the equal number of houses, decreases by $$1$$, not changing it overall.  So if two median houses are at locations $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$ ($$x_2 \ge x_1$$)we just return the number of points between them, their locations included, that is $$x_2-x_1+1$$.
