We have a total of $$G = \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}$$ games and the number of wins for each team must be equal and so each team should win $$\lfloor \frac{G}{n} \rfloor$$ times and also lose that many times.  How do we construct such schedule of games?  The easiest way is for team $$i$$ to win against the following teams, i.e. $$i+1, i+2, \ldots$$ (everything modulo $$n$$).
