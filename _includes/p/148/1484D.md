It helps to first think how we would naively simulate it.  We need to remove entries so let's keep everything on a doubly linked circular list.

Why simple simulation is not good enough?  Because we can have an input like lots of $$2$$s followed by lots of $$3$$ and we only do one deletion per "round" so this is going to be too slow.

One way to speed it up is to in addition to regular pointers in the list add "shortcut" links.  If we go through a block $$a_1, \ldots a_n$$ without doing any deletions and then finally do a deletion from $$a_n$$ to $$b$$ then we add shortcuts from $$a_1, \ldots a_{n-1}$$ to $$a_n$$ as those numbers (on their own) will never be reduced.

From here on it's just a matter of careful implementation; when done properly this is actually short and sweet.  What helps a lot is that we have a fixed initial size of the input so instead of doing any pointers we just store appropriate indices in static arrays.
