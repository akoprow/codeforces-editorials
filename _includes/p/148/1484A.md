It's fairly easy to find a solution with $$n \cdot m$$, for instance doing a snake like pattern from top-left to bottom, going row by row.  An argument why that's optimal is: if we think about it as a graph we start with $$n \cdot m$$ components and with one move we connect at most two into ones, so we need $$n \cdot m - 1$$ move to make the graph connected, plus one to connect with the outside world.
