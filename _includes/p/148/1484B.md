Let's look at all the differences of consecutive elements.  We have few cases:

- if there's just one distinct value we can choose infinitely many large $$m$$s.
- if there are more than two distinct values then there is no answer.
- why can we have two values?  Because one (positive) might be a "regular" one bumping up by $$c$$ and the other one (negative) might be once we "wrap up" modulo $$m$$.  In this case the positive one is $$c$$ and $$m$$ is the difference between the two.  What remains to be done is to check whether this is indeed a valid solution.
