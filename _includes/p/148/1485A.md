It's fairly easy to realize that we want to increase $$b$$ as much as possible before starting to divide by it (by looking at those two operations next to each other it's obvious).  So just make sure that $$b$$ isn't $$1$$ (if it is increase it once) and then keep on increasing $$b$$ and for each one check what the score is by doing repeated division.  What's the stop condition?  Once a given $$b$$ gives us score worse than what we've got as a best one so far.
