We just need to make a simple observation that if we reach a configuration where a boulder falls into the collection system then clearly all the subsequent ones will too.  And moreover since all heights are at most $$100$$, this game will have at most $$100\cdot n$$ steps before it's over.  So we can just do the simulation of the boulder falling and even with the naive approach we end up with a $$O(100\cdot n^2)$$ solution which is plenty good.
