The trick is to realize that there are relatively few solutions and rather than looking for them we must find a trick that "always works".  The idea is to divide the board into 2-colors so that we always have adjacent cells of different colors and then write into them $$p+q$$ and $$p$$.  From the problem we have the following constraints:

- $$p, q \ge 1$$,
- $$p$$ is a multiple of the value in one of the cells,
- $$p+q$$ is a multiple of the value in the other cell,
- $$q$$ is equal to $$k^4$$ for some $$k$$,
- $$p + q \le 10^6$$.

Can we find a $$(p, q)$$ pair that satisfies those constraints?  Turns out we can.

- $$p$$ must be a multiple of a number in given cell (any cell) so our best bet is $$lcm(1, 2, \ldots 16) = 720720$$.
- $$q$$ must be a multiple of a number in a given cell *and* a $$4$$'th power of some number so we can just take $$v^4$$ where $$v$$ is the value in the cell.
- $$p + q = 720720 + v^4 \le 720720 + 16^4 = 786256 \le 10^6$$.
