Let's think what's the minimal happy configuration.  Clearly it's stacks with $$1, 2, 3, \ldots$$, so if we don't have that many blocks in total we won't be able to make a right sequence.  Also, blocks can only move to the right and so the aforementioned condition needs to hold for every index.  If it does then we win as we can clearly send all the surplus above what's required to the right.
