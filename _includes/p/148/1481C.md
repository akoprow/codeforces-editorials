Crucial observation here is that the last painter is the key, as whatever he paints will have to remain of color $$c_m$$.  Let's find $$i$$ such that $$b_i = c_m$$.  We have three options:

- $$a_i \neq b_i$$, we prefer this option over the next one, as in this way the work of the last painter is useful and we might have to make use of that in order to get to the solution,
- $$a_i = b_i$$, in which case his work wasn't necessarily required but we end up with the right color and clearly we did not have the need for painting anything in this color (if we did, we'd have fallen into the previous case),
- there is no $$i$$ such that $$b_i = c_m$$, in which case clearly there is no solution as the painter has to paint and some plank will end up with that color.

If we fell into one of the first two cases then all that remains is for the remaining painters to greedily one by one:

- if the painter paints in a color that we need for some plank then let's use him there,
- otherwise let's make him paint plank $$i$$, as the last painter will repaint in anyway.

Now we only need to check if we repainted all the planks that needed repainting and we're done.

My solution during the live round was somewhat more complicated than that.
