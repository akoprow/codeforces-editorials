The case when $$n$$ is even is each as the cats never "collide".

Otherwise, we can see that they'll collide every $$\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$$ moves, so in total they'll collide $$C = \frac{k}{n/2}$$ times.  Each collision means that cat $$A$$ moves by $$2$$ spots rather than $$1$$ (since the next one is occupied) and so he'll eventually reach position $$((k+C) % n$$ (0-based).
