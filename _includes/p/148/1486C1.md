It's fairly easy to see that binary search is the way to go.  $$log_2 10^5 < 17$$, so we can do $$2$$ queries at every step.  How do we decide if the max is in the left or the right part?  Well, firstly let's ask for the whole interval, i.e. $$[l, r]$$.  Assume that the answer, $$x$$, is in the left part (other case is symmetrical), i.e. $$x \in [l, m]$$ ($$m = \frac{l+r}{2}$$).  In that case let's ask for that interval $$[l, m]$$.  If the answer is $$x$$ again then that means that globally second element is there and it's also a second element in the left part so max must be there as well; otherwise we go to the right part.
