The following greedy strategy works, let's construct two optimal subsequences and their last elements (as only those matter) be $$a_l$$ and $$a_r$$ and we're now looking at element $$b$$.  Then:

- if $$a_l = b$$ and $$a_r \neq b$$ then assign $$b$$ to the right subsequence and we increase the score by $$1$$.
- similarly, if $$a_r = b$$ and $$a_l \neq b$$ then assign $$b$$ to the left subsequence and we increase the score by $$1$$.
- if $$a_l = a_r = b$$ then clearly it does not matter to which sequence we assign it.
- finally if $$a_l \neq b$$ and $$a_r \neq b$$ then assign $$b$$ then check whether in the remaining subsequence we will first get another $$a_l$$ or another $$a_r$$.  In the former case assign $$b$$ to $$a_l$$, in the latter to $$a_r$$.

Formally proving that this works is not trivial.

I had a completely different reasoning to this which goes something likes this (and unfortunately does not generalize to `D2`):

- let's count the longest blocks of equal numbers
- if the block has one element we can always score $$1$$ for it.
- no matter how long the block we can never score more than $$2$$ for it, as at best we can start two new segments in $$a_l$$ and $$a_r$$.
- but clearly we cannot always score $$2$$ as in the sequence: $$2, 2, 1, 2, 2$$.
- let's keep count of: last seen double and number of "neutral" elements, starting with no doubles and 0 neutral elements.
- if we see a single number then if it's equal to last seen double then we decrement the number of "neutral" elements, otherwise we increment it and regardless we increase score by one.
- if we get two neutral elements then we can forget about the last double, it's been neutralized by them (i.e. we know that in both $$a_l$$ and $$a_r$$ last element is different to it).
- if we see a second number that is different than the last double then we increment the score by one, reset neutral elements and remember that this element is the new double.
