Notice that if we have two heroes with levels $$a_i$$ and $$a_j$$ such that $$a_i > a_j$$ then $$a_i$$ can easily reach arbitrarily high level by continuing to fight with $$a_j$$ over and over again.  So any hero that initially has at least one other hero who's weaker than him can do that.  Also notice that if for any hero there is no one weaker than him initially then this will continue to be this case as the levels are only ever increasing and so such hero will forever remain at his level and won't be able to reach $$100^{500}$$.
