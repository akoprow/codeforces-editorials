Since we're looking at lexicographic ordering, it's pretty clear everyone in their move should always change the most significant available letter.  Note that even if it's Alice's turn and the first character is "a", so she cannot improve it from her point of view, she should still change it to "b" (next best), because if she did not Bob would next change it to "z"!

So Alice changes all letters at odd positions and Bob at even positions.  Alice changes to "a" if possible, or "b" otherwise and Bob changes to "z" if possible and "y" otherwise.
