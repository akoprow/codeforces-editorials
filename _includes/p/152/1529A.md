Firstly, it's easy to see that we will never be able to remove the minimal element(s).  To do so we would need the average of picked numbers to be strictly less than the minimum, but this is impossible as the minimum is the smallest number we can pick.

Secondly, we can remove all the other elements: just pick the minimum and the element to be removed.

So, overall, we just check what's the minimum, count how many such elements there are and everything else can be removed.
