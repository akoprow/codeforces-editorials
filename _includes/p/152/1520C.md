As it turns out $$n = 2$$ is the only case where there is no answer.  For all the other numbers we can do a simple construction of dividing the board into black and white cells, like a chessboard.  First fill black cells row by row from $$1$$ going up and then continue, similarly, with higher numbers for white cells, so that for instance for $$n = 3$$ we get:

$$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 6 & 2 \\ 7 & 3 & 8 \\ 4 & 9 & 5 \end{pmatrix}$$
