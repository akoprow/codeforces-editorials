We covered in `B1` the case when the string is a palindrome.  If it is not then Alice almost always wins as she can:

- revert the string, unless
- the string is one step away from becoming a palindrome with an even number of zeroes.  In that case she makes it so and we're back to a palindrome case, in which Alice wins by at least $$2\$ $$ and she paid $$1\$ $$ in this steps so she still wins.

The only scenario that leads to a draw is if the string has $$2$$ zeroes and one of them is in the middle as in this case they will both pay $$ 1\$ $$ when played optimally:

- If Alice takes the non-middle $$0$$, Bob needs to take the middle.
- If Alice reverts the string then Bob takes the non-middle $$0$$ and Alice needs to take the middle one.
- If Alice take the middle $$0$$ then Bob reverts and Alice lost so she will not do that.
