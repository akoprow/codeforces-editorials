First, observe that we can always add all non-positive elements.  For them $$\mid x - y \mid \ge 0$$ and the maximum is at most $$0$$ so we're good.

Can we add more?  It's easy to see that we cannot add more than one positive elements.  Suppose we tried to add $$x, y > 0$$, but then we have $$\mid x - y \mid < x$$ and so necessarily also less than maximum.

So now we now we can add at most one positive number.  Clearly the smallest one is the best as it puts least constraints.  So just take it and see if it works by checking all consecutive pairs in sorted order.
