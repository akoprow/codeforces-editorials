Let's denote the number of combinations for $$n$$ pairs of points by $$f(n)$$.  So let's say we have $$n$$ pairs of points, how can we connect them?

Firstly, we can connect the first and last points, everything else will be inside that arc so we can put there any solution for $$n-1$$ pairs of points.  Similarly we can connect first and last but one and second and last points; the arcs will intersect but will have the same length and we have $$n-2$$ points left that we can use arbitrarily as they'll be inside those two initial arcs.  And so on.

Secondly, we can make all the arcs have equal lengths, which will trivially satisfy correctness constraints. For instance for 6 points we can connect them as: $$(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)$$ or $$(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)$$ with arc lengths of $$1$$ and $$3$$ respectively.  Notice that the number of points being divisible by the arc lengths is the only requirement here.

Putting those two together we get the final formula as:

$$f(n) = \mathcal{D}(n) + \sum_{i \in {1 \ldots n-1}} f(i)$$

where $$\mathcal{D}(n)$$ is the number of divisors of $$n$$.
