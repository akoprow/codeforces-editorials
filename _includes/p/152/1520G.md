Firstly, observe that there is no point to using portal more than once.  If we have a solution that uses portal multiple times then we can always jump from the first portal immediately to the last, removing the part in the middle and reducing the cost.  So the answer can have one of the two forms:

- go from start to end without any use of portals.
- go from start to portal $$A$$, teleport to $$B$$ and go from there to the end.

We can compute costs of those options by doing a flood algorithm from start and keeping track of:

- the cheapest direct route to the end (if any) and
- the cheapest way to some portal + cost of taking that portal.

Then we do flood from the end to compute:

- the cheapest way from end to some portal + cost of taking it.

Combining the two we get the answers for the original two options and we're done.

Careful that both start and end can be portals (I failed during the contest because of that).
