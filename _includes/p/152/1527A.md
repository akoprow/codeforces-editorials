Let's take the highest set bit in $$n$$, suppose it is $$2^k$$.  Now, clearly $$(2^k) \& (2^k-1) = 0$$ as the former only has the $$k$$-th bit set and the latter has all the lower bits but not the $$k$$-th one.  So $$2^k-1$$ is an answer.  It's easy to see that there is not a better one since all numbers from $$2^k$$ up to $$n$$ have the $$k$$-th bit set.
