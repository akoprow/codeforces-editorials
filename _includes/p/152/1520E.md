I solved it by considering all sheeps one by one and assuming that a given sheep is stationary.  Then with a DP it's possible for every prefix to compute the cost of moving all the sheep up until that position to form a line ending at that position (i.e. going from $$*.*.* \to ..***$$) and similarly for every suffix.

But actually there's a much simpler solution hinging on the fact that if there are $$k$$ sheeps then in the optimal solution sheep $$\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil$$ should remain stationary and then it's just a simple single sweep calculation.
