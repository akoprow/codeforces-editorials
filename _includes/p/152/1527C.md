Let's look at all the contributions of all segments ending at character $$i$$.  They can be classified as:

- All the contributions ending at character $$i-1$$ (we extend those by 1 letter to the right but not yet count the pairs matched with character $$i$$).
- Suppose we have another occurrence of the same element at index $$j$$ ($$j < i$$), how much will this pair contribute?  Well, $$j$$, as it will be included in subsegments $$[1, i], [2, i], \ldots [j, i]$$.  So overall we get $$j_1 + \ldots + j_n$$ where $$j_1, \ldots, j_n$$ are indices of previous occurrences of the element at position $$i$$.  We can easily keep track of that by having a map from element to the prefix sum of its indices seen so far.
