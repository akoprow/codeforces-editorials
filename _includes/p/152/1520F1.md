This is just a simple binary search.  We will maintain a segment in which the $$k$$'th zero must be, starting with the full $$[0, n-1]$$ segment.

Let's say we are looking for the $$k$$'th zero and we know it is within $$[l, r]$$.  Pick $$m = \lfloor \frac{l+r}{2} \rfloor$$, ask for segment $$[l, m]$$.  Let's say the answer is $$s$$.  Than means that there are $$z = m-l+1-s$$ zeros in that segment and so:

- if $$z \ge k$$ then we continue searching for $$k$$ zeros in $$[l, m]$$
- if $$z < k$$ then we continue searching for $$k-z$$ zeros in $$[m+1, r]$$.

We end up asking at most $$\log n$$ queries, which is fine.
