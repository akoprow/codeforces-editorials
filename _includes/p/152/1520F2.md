This is similar to the easy problem except we need to be smarter and remember responses and re-use answers rather than asking again.

When doing so we need to be careful to account for the changes in the array by remembering that the zeroes we guessed so far were changed into ones.  The easiest way to do it is to store answers pertaining to the original array and then when re-using an answer for segment $$[l, r]$$, add to it the number of guessed zeros we've made so far in that range (by using an OST).
