Firstly, let's assume that the palindrome has an even length.  Then Bob wins.  This is because initially string is a palindrome so Alice needs to turn some $$0$$ into $$1$$ and Bob can:

- If there is more than one $$0$$ left he mimics this move at the corresponding position in the palindrome.  This again gives a palindrome to Alice in her next move.
- If there is only one $$0$$ he can reverse the palindrome and so Alice will be forced in the next move to remove the remaining $$0$$ and lose by at least $$2\$ $$

What if the initial palindrome has an odd length?  If the character in the middle is $$1$$ then it does not change anything.  If it's a zero then Alice can turn it into $$1$$ and win as now Bob is given the starting position equivalent to that for even-length scenario described above.

Note that those conditions can be simplified as: Bob wins if there is an even number of zeroes whereas Alice wins if there is an odd number.
