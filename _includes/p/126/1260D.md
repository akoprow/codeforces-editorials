Nice one!  Compute minimal satisfactory ability with binary search and then simply compute how many soldiers we have with appropriate ability.

Minimal ability is $$(n+1) + 2*costSegments$$, i.e. the cost to bring the squad to the boss and to disarm all dangerous traps.  $$costSegments$$ is $$seg_r - seg_l + 1$$ for all merged segments such that their danger is bigger than ability we're considering (i.e. we need to disarm).
