Tricky until you realize that:

- If any number is negative then the answer is "NO".  This is because: take that negative number and the largest other number $$p$$ (there must be at least one).  The difference between them will be larger than $$p$$ and we'd have to repeat this process ad infinitum adding new numbers so no dice.
- Otherwise all the numbers are between $$0$$ and $$100$$ so $$0, 1, \ldots, 100$$ is always a valid answer.
