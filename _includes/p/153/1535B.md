The optimal strategy is to put the even numbers at the front of the array, as then they will form a good pair with both even and odd numbers to their right.

So let's say we have $$n_{even}$$ even elements and $$n_{odd}$$ odd ones.  We have the following observations:

- all the even elements form good pairs with all the other even elements, which contributes: $$n_{even}\cdot(n_{even}-1)/2$$.
- all the even elements form good pairs with all the odd elements (since we put them to their right), contributing: $$n_{even} \cdot n_{odd}$$.

So we're left with figuring out how many good pairs do we have among odd elements.  Since none of the elements is divisible by $$2$$ the elements $$x$$ and $$y$$ form a good pair only if $$gcd(x, y) > 1$$ and we can check that condition directly for all the pairs of odd elements.
