I solved it in a much more convoluted way but a simple solution goes as follows.

Visualize this on a XY plane where 'D' goes up and 'K' goes right.  The tangent corresponds to the ration of $$Ds/Ks$$ and so we can split at every point which has the same tangent as our current point.  So we can just count the numbers of 'D', $$c_D$$, and 'K', $$c_K$$, store them in a multiset of pairs as:

$$(\frac{c_D}{gcd(c_D, c_K)}, \frac{c_K}{gcd(c_D, c_K)})$$

and the cardinality of the element we're inserting is the answer at that position.
