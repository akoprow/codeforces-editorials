Visualize the tournament bracket as a binary tree.  Leaves are first round games.  Root is the final.  Values in the nodes denote the number of teams that can win a given game.  For simplicity let's actually add an extra layer of leaves which are all $$1$$ and will never change: those are the teams on their own.  Then for the internal nodes we have the following rules depending on the value in the string for that game:

- for $$0$$, i.e. lower numbered team wins, then the value of the node equals the value of the left child
- for $$1$$ then, similarly, the value is the values of the right child and
- for $$?$$, i.e. either team can win, it's the sum of both children.

We can easily construct that tree for the initial configuration and we can also easily update, as each update only changes the node in question, plus requires re-computation for all the nodes on the path to the root.  The only difficulty remaining is to translate between game numbers and positions of the nodes in our binary tree (which, of course, we store in an array).
