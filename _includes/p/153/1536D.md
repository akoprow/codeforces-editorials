We can solve this by keeping track of:

- $$v_1 \le v_2 \ldots \le v_n$$ being the elements that must necessarily belong to the array we're trying to reconstruct.
- $$c_\ge$$: the number of elements that are greater or equal than $$v_n$$ but otherwise unconstrained and
- $$c_\le$$: the number of elements that are smaller or equal than $$v_1$$ but otherwise unconstrained.

Note that when considering a new element:

- if it's not in $$v_1, \ldots, v_n$$ we need to add it there,
- all the remaining moves can be used to increment $$c_\ge$$ or $$c_\le$$ in such a way as to try to make our element a new median (note that it might not be possible)

It can be implemented using an Ordered Statistic Tree.
