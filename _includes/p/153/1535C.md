We'll iterate through characters and keep track of two variables: $$z$$ and $$o$$, indicating, the lengths of the longest beautiful string ending at current position with a $$0$$, respectively, $$1$$.

Transitions are as follows:

- if next character is $$0$$: $$(z', o') := (o+1, 0)$$ because we can extend a beautiful string ending with a $$1$$ by one character and get another beautiful string and there is no way for us to end with a $$1$$.  This contributes $$z'$$ (for all the beautiful strings ending with a $$0$$).
- if next character is $$1$$ it's symmetrical: $$(z', o') := (0, z+1)$$ and we add $$o'$$ to the answer.
- if next characters is $$?$$ we have: $$(z', o') := (o+1, z+1)$$ since we can replace $$?$$ with either $$0$$ or $$1$$.  Note however that this contributes $$max(z', o')$$ as we can pick whatever we like for $$?$$ to make the beautiful string as long as possible (but we cannot score for both $$0$$ and $$1$$ variants at once).
