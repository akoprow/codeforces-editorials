It's fairly clear that if we have to make $$l, r, u, d$$ moves left, right, up and down, respectively, from $$(x, y)$$ then we'll end up at position:

$$(x + r - l, y + u - d)$$

Clearly, that position needs to be within the bounds, so:

$$x_1 \le x + r - l \le x_2 \ \ \ and\ \ \ y_1 \le y + u - d \le y_2$$

but is that enough?  No, because if $$l = r$$ then we will end up in the same spot on the $$x$$-axis but if $$x_1 = x_2$$ then we cannot make any moves to the left/right.  So additionally we need to check that:

$$x_1 < x_2 \ \ \ or \ \ \ l = r = 0$$

$$y_1 < y_2 \ \ \ or \ \ \ u = d = 0$$

If all those conditions hold then that's enough.  We can always alternate left/right until we run out of either (similarly for up/down) which means we will always remain in the rectangle defined by the origin point and the destination.  And since both of those points are within the valid rectangle then so must be all the intermediate points.
