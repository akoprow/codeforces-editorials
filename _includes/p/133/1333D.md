Tricky tricky!  So one move goes from $$LR$$ to $$RL$$ and there are no more moves only upon reaching $$RRR \ldots LLL$$, so what's happening is essentially sorting using bubble sort.  What's the minimal and maximal $$k$$ that we can achieve?  Minimal is clearly the number of phases of full bubble sort, maximal is the total number of moves we perform.  So we can perform bubble sort, store the possible moves (as a list of phases, where each phase is a list of moves in that phase).  Then we check is we can achieve $$k$$, if not just output $$-1$$ but if we can we need to construct the answer.

How do we do it?  Essentially we can greedily use as many moves as available in the phase, until reaching a point where we have as many moves left as the number of rounds we still need to generate, at which point we continue outputting one move per round.

Efficient implementation required; I struggled a lot with TLE.
