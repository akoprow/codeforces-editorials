Fairly simple iteration; starting at $$1$$ we go through positions, if currently considered position does not belong to $$a$$ -- i.e. we've never gotten this position in the contest so far -- then we decrement $$x$$ by one (we need one contest to get this position) and continue until $$x$$ drops to $$0$$.
