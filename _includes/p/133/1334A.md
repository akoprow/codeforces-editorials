So what conditions need to hold for a single move to be "valid"? (i.e. to correspond to some hypothetical sequence of plays).  Let's call $$\Delta_p$$ and $$\Delta_c$$ the differences between the current and previous number of games, and number of clears, respectively (we can add $$(0, 0)$$ sentinel pair at the beginning to easily deal with the first entry).  Since the stats are given in chronological order, clearly neither can be negative.  Moreover $$\Delta_c$$ is bound by $$\Delta_p$$ (most clears we can have if every game was finished successfully) and so we cannot have $$\Delta_c > \Delta_p$$.  It's fairly easy to convince oneself that those conditions are enough.
