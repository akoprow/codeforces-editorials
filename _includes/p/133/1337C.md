Crucial observation is that in the optimal solution if any city is chosen to develop tourism then all the cities on its path to the root will be tourist cities too.  Why?  Suppose there's a tourism city whose parent is an industry city. Swap them an we get a solution that is at least as good.

With this observation for every city we can calculate how much happiness we will get by choosing it to be a tourism city. Consider a node $$u$$ at depth $$d_u$$ whose subtree has size $$s_u$$.  Then if we pick this city to develop tourism happiness will increase by $$s_u - d_u$$, because the envoy from $$u$$ won't be sent loosing us $$d_u-1$$ happiness but $$s_u-1$$ envoys from the subtree will get $$1$$ happiness each from passing by node $$u$$.

So now we can simply calculate $$s_u - d_u$$ for all nodes $$u$$, pick $$n-k$$ largest elements and report their sum as the answer.
