Let's think of boundary cases, i.e. given $$l_1, \ldots, l_m$$ what's the minimum and maximum $$n$$ for which we are able to find a solution?

For maximum it's clear that we just paint non-overlapping segments and so $$n_{max} = \sum_i l_i$$.

For minimum we want to overlap them one by one but be careful because each segment must fit within the $$n$$ slots, which leads to $$n_{min} = max_i \{ i + l_i \}$$.

Now we can check if given $$n$$ falls within those limits.  If it does not we simply answer $$-1$$.

If it does we do a construction.  See that the minimal case maps to $$p_i = i$$ and the maximal case maps to $$p_i = n - \sum_{j=i+1}^{m} l_j$$.  Combining those two we arrive at:

$$p_i = max(im, n - \sum_{j=i+1}^{m} l_j)$$

which we can easily compute in constant time with help of prefix sums on $$l$$.
