It's pretty clear that we should start shooting at some monster $$i$$ until we kill it and then continue clockwise until done, thus maximizing the damage due to explosions.

So the only question is where to start.  If we start with the second monster then we need to shoot it $$a_1$$ times and all the remaining ones $$max(0, a_i - b_{i-1})$$ times.  That means we want to pick $$i$$ that minimizes $$a_{i+1} - max(0, a_{i+1}-b{i})$$, which is the extra number of shots we need to spend because we cannot use the explosion of the previous monster.  Once we find that we can easily calculate the total cost starting at $$i$$.
