Finding optimal path should be done greedily, i.e. at every step we make move to the lowest numbered note such that we will be able to complete the Euler cycle by doing so.  This follows from the fact that we're looking for a lexicographically smallest one.

For example a solution for $$n=5$$ is:

$$1\ 2\ 1\ 3\ 1\ 4\ 1\ 5\ 2\ 3\ 2\ 4\ 2\ 5\ 3\ 4\ 3\ 5\ 4\ 5\ 1$$

The crucial observation is to find a recursive structure in this procedure, i.e.:

$$(1\ 2\ 1\ 3\ 1\ 4\ 1\ 5\ (2\ 3\ 2\ 4\ 2\ 5\ (3\ 4\ 3\ 5\ (4\ 5\ ())))\ 1)$$

Once we see that it's just a matter of writing a loop for each of those segments, have counter for the nodes and print them only if it is within the segment of interest $$[l, r]$$.  Additionally, instead of iterating we can skip a full segment if we see that it does not intersect $$[l, r]$$ at all, hence reducing the complexity from $$O(n^2)$$ to $$O(\mid r-l \mid)$$.
