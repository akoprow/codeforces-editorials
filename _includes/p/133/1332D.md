It's essentially stated in the problem that the presented dp solution does not always produce the optimal solution.

An important observation is that there is a bit that none of the input numbers has but we can use in our output.

Finally, it's relatively easy to fool the dp solution into producing $$0$$ as answer, so all we are left to do is to ensure that the real solution is $$k$$.

As it turns out we can always achieve that with the following matrix:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
2^{17}+k & 2^{17}+k & 2^{17} \\
2^{17}+k & k & 2^{17}+k \\
2^{17} & 2^{17}+k & k
\end{pmatrix}$$

We can see that there's a path with $$k$$ in every position so that's the real answer; however we fool the "greedy" dp by "convincing" it to go instead for $$2^17$$ which fails in the end as $$2^{17} \& k = 0$$.
