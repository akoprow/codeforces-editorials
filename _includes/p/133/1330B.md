One direct option is to just do a sweep and keep track of left/right elements as multisets and with a little bit of extra bookkeeping we can in $$O(1)$$ time see if those multisets are valid permutations, which is the case only if

- there are no duplicates and
- $$max(M) = \mid M \mid$$.

But there's a simpler solution.  If $$a$$ can be recovered into two permutations $$p_1$$ and $$p_2$$ then $$max(a) = max(\mid p_1 \mid, \mid p_2 \mid)$$, which leads to only two possible cases: $$\mid p_1 \mid = max(a)$$ and $$\mid p_2 \mid = n - max(a)$$, or vice versa.  We can easily check both options in linear time.
