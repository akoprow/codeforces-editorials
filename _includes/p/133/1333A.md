My solution involved painting columns in interleaved black-white colors with some extra corrections to make the counts right.

There is a much simpler solution though: pain the top-left corner white and everything else black.  Then the white count is $$1$$ for cell $$(1, 1)$$ and black count is $$2$$ for cells $$(1, 2)$$ and $$(2, 1)$$.
