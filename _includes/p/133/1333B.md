First observe that an element $$a_i$$ cannot affect any $$b_j$$ with $$j < i$$.  So as we sweep for left to right we keep track of operations that we can apply from that point on.  Initially that set is empty and as we see $$+1$$ or $$-1$$ in $$a_i$$ we extend this set.  At the same time we compare $$a_i$$ with $$b_i$$.  If they are equal we are good.  If $$b_i < a_i$$ we must have $$-1$$ as an operation at our disposal, in which case we can decrement $$a_i$$ as needed down to $$b_i$$.  Similarly if $$b_i > a_i$$ we must have $$+1$$.  Note that we can always do the actual modifications from right-to-left so that we don't have to worry about our $$+1$$ / $$-1$$ changing to something else before we apply it.
