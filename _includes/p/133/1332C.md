It's relatively easy to convince oneself that for the word to be k-complete each of it's k-length blocks itself needs to be a palindrome.  That means that we have a number of positions which all need to have the same letter, essentially:

- for a given block of length $$l$$ positions $$i$$ and $$l-i$$ need to have the same letter (that's because the block needs to be a palindrome) and this needs to hold across all blocks.
- if blocks have odd lengths then we need to be careful with the middle letter in the block as then $$i$$ and $$l-i$$ collapse into the same position in the middle.

So now can process each such a collection of letters independently.  To do so we simply count the frequencies of all letters in a collection, pick the most frequent letter and change all the remaining ones to be it.
