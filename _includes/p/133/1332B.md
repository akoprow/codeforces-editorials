The crucial observation is that we can assign the $$11$$ available colors to the first $$11$$ primes:

$$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31$$.

Now, given any number $$v$$ we assign it to the bucket of any of the above primes $$p$$, provided that $$v$$ is divisible by $$p$$.  Why is it always possible?  Well, the smallest composite number that does not have a divisor in that list is $$37*37 = 1369$$ ($$37$$ being the next prime after $$31$$ but we know all numbers are at most a $$1000$$.

Another way to reason why this works is to note that each composite number $$n$$ has a prime divisor $$p$$, such that $$p \le \sqrt(n)$$.  Since $$\sqrt(1000) < 32$$ the above list of primes gets us covered.
