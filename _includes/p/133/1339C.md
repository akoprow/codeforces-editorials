In round $$i$$ we're adding $$2^i$$ to arbitrary elements in the array and the question is what's the smallest $$i$$ that after $$i$$-th round we can make the array non-decreasing?  Let's look at all subsequent elements $$a_i > a_{i+1}$$.  If there is no such pair we're done, if there are many let's take the largest one.  Suppose $$\delta = a_i - a_{i+1}$$ is the largest such difference.  We need to bump $$a_{i+1}$$ by at least $$\delta$$.  However many rounds we need for that will allow us to make the whole array non-decreasing.  Note that when we're bumping an index, we can always bump the whole suffix from then on, meaning we do not disturb relative differences between any other elements.
