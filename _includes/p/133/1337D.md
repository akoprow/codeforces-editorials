Let's start by simplifying the problem a little bit.  Let's say the optimal solution involves picking $$r_x, g_y, b_z$$.  Let's assume that we have $$r_x \le g_y \le b_z$$ and that we know $$g_y$$, how do we find optimal $$r_x$$ and $$b_z$$ then?  Well, it's simple we use binary search to find largest value less than or equal than $$g_y$$ among red gems and smallest value greater than or equal than $$g_y$$ among blue gems.

How do we get around the fact that we know what $$g_y$$ is?  Simply try all of them.

How do we get around the fact that we don't know what the order between optimal gems is?  Simply try all 6 permutations.

All of this gives us $$O(n \log n)$$ solution which is good enough.
