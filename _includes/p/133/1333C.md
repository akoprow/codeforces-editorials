Firstly notice monitonicity of the good-ness property.  If an array is not good then its extended version will also not be good and also if it is good then all its subarrays must be good.

That means that looking at position $$i$$ we want to find largest $$j$$ such that $$[a_i, \ldots a_j]$$ is good.  Let's call that index $$R(i)$$ in which case this index will contribute $$R(i)-i+1$$ to the answer.  But doing that naively would lead to $$O(n^2)$$ solution which is not good enough.

Let's compute prefix sums for the array: $$S_0 = 0, S_p = \sum_{i = 1,\ldots,p} a_i$$.  Notice that $$[a_i, \ldots a_j]$$ has a zero sum iff $$S_{i-1} = S{j}$$.  In other words a prefix is good iff the corresponding array of prefix sums has no duplicates.  And so now for each index to compute its $$R(i)$$ we can iterate over prefix sums array until we find a duplicate

How do we improve the overall complexity?  Using previous observations we can see that $$R(i)$$ is monotonous, i.e. $$R(i+1) \ge R(i)$$ simply because if $$[a_i, \ldots, a_{R(i)}]$$ was good then $$[a_{i+1}, \ldots, A_{R(i)}]$$ must also be good.  So while computing $$R(i+1)$$ we start from $$R(i)$$ and from a set of prefix sums from previous iterations, only after removing the prefix sum corresponding to $$a_i$$ which is now gone.  We're now down to $$O(n \log n)$$ which works.
