Note that the part in the middle, $$a_{k+1}$$, has no constraints and is arbitrary so we want to make all $$a_1, \ldots, a_k$$ as short as possible. Notice also that if any $$a_i = s \cdot t$$ then it can be split into two: $$s$$ and $$t$$.  Which means all $$a_i$$ are single letters.  Which means we need to have:

- first $$k$$ letters concatenated with last $$k$$ letters must be a palindrome and
- $$n > 2k$$ (so that we have at least one letter left for $$a_{k+1}$$).
