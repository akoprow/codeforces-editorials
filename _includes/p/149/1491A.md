Since we have $$n$$ elements that are only $$0$$ or $$1$$ knowing how many $$1$$s (or $$0$$s) there are is enough to know what the $$k$$-th largest element will be (i.e. it will be $$1$$ if we have at least $$k$$ ones).  So it's enough to keep track of the number of ones and update it appropriately when flipping some element.
