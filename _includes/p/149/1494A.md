Probably the easiest solution is just to brute force it and try all combinations of parenthesis for all of $$A, B, C$$, since there are only $$2^3 = 8$$ combinations.  Alternatively, we can observe that the sequence must start with opening and must end with a closing parenthesis.

Once we have a fixed meaning for every letter it's just a matter of applying the classical algorithm of counting $$+1$$ for opening and $$-1$$ for closing parenthesis and the sequence is valid if:

- we never go below $$0$$ (closing parenthesis that is unmatched) and
- at the end we reach $$0$$ (everything balanced out in the end)
