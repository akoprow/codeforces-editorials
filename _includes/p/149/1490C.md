Note that $$\sqrt[3]{10^{12}} = 10^4$$, so in other words the largest number that is useful to use is $$10000$$, so for all numbers up to that limit we can precompute their cubes and store in a set.  Then if we want to see if $$x$$ can be represented as sum of cubes, iterate over stored cubes smaller than $$x$$ and for each $$v^3$$, check if $$x - v^3$$ is in our precomputed set (i.e. is a cube of some number).
