The crucial observation is that the winning $$C$$ must be a frequency of some element in the array.  And we can have at most $$\sqrt{n}$$ different candidates for $$C$$ (elements with counts $$1, 2, 3, \ldots$$ has a quadratic growth).  So let's just compute frequencies of all elements to get our candidates.

Now for a given $$C$$ computing the cost to make array $$C$$-beautiful is easy, as for a given element with $$x$$ occurrences we have to pay:

- $$x$$ if $$x < C$$ as we need to remove all $$x$$ copies.
- $$0$$ if $$x = C$$,
- $$x-C$$ if $$x > C$$ as we need to remove extra copies.

Then we simply pick the best option over all candidate $$C$$s.
