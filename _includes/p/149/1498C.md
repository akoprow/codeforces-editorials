This screams DP.  Let's call by $$\mathcal{D}_{i, j}$$ the number of particles we finally get after a single one hits a plane so that it will $$i$$ planes to go through going right and it has power $$j$$.

For boundary conditions clearly if power is $$1$$ then answer is $$1$$ as it won't get cloned.

Otherwise we will get:

- $$\mathcal{D}_{i-1, j}$$ particles after moving right, i.e. we have one fewer planes to go through and our power does not change and
- $$\mathcal{D}_{n-i, j-1}$$ particles after moving left, i.e. our power goes down by one and going to the left is the same as going through the right in the mirror image, so we appropriately adjust the number of planes on our way.

Another option was to have another dimension of the DP indicating direction of travel and it's quite possible that this was easier to code quickly and correctly.
