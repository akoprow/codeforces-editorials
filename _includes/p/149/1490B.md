Numbers don't matter, only their remainder modulo $$3$$.  Let's count $$c_0, c_1, c_2$$ being the number of elements with respective remainders.  In a single move we can decrement $$c_i$$ and increment $$c_{(i+1) \mod 3}$$.  One greedy approach that we can take is:

- as long as there's $$c_i$$ that is too large, take it and move it to "the next slot" ($$\mod 3$$).
- it can be shown that at most two rounds through all $$c_i$$ will do.
