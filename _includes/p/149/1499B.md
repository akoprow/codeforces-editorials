Eventually we want to have all $$0$$s on some prefix and all $$1$$s from then on.  What's the longest prefix where we can make all $$0$$s?  Well, until we hit two $$1$$s next to each other.  From that point onwards we can make all $$1$$s until we hit two $$0$$s next to each other.  If by doing those two steps we processed the whole string we're good; otherwise the answer is clearly "NO".
