Clearly the answer is the minimum over answers per lane.  For swimmer who does laps in $$a$$ how long will we have to wait for him after arriving at time $$p$$?  Let's look at $$a \mod p$$.  If $$a \mod p = 0$$ then he arrives just at the point when we do so the answer is $$0$$; otherwise it's $$a - a \mod p$$ as we'll need to wait for him to complete his lap.  Now take a minimum over answers for $$a, b, c$$.
