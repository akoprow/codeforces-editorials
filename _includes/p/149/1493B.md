Simple on the surface but the devil is in the (implementation) details.  Let's say the given time is $$H:M$$.

There are two possible approaches: brute-force by going through all possible hour/time combinations and from the correct ones choose the one that happens soonest after $$H:M$$.  Hour/time is correct if:

- it only contains symmetrical digits ($$0, 1, 2, 5, 8$$),
- mirrored image is a valid time, i.e. its hour and minute are within the given bounds.

Another option was to:

- Iterate minutes from $$M+1$$ to the last valid minute ($$m-1$$) and if that together with the original hour is valid then clearly that's the answer (we stay within the same hour).
- If there is no solution above then that means there is no solution within the given hour.  But then it's easy to see that minutes will be $$00$$ as it's always valid and it's the smallest value for minutes.  So let's iterate *hours* from $$H+1$$ to the last valid hour ($$h-1$$) and if that paired with $$00$$ for minutes is valid then that's our answer (we stay within the same day).
- Otherwise, we need to go to the following day and then $$00:00$$ is the answer.
