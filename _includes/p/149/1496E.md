Firstly let's unpack all the fluff from the description: we have a number of $$X$$s and we want to connect all of them, by adding new $$X$$s, in such a way that we cannot create any cycles.

We can do that by fully filling every third column.  If we have any $$X$$s on the remaining two columns they will automatically be connected to their closer column.  So what remains to be done is just to extend any of them into a full connection between said columns (or just add a "bridge" if no $$X$$s exist in the two columns under consideration).
