Firstly note that all the numbers don't matter only for each pair of numbers which one is bigger.  Visualize this as a game on "hills" created from the numbers; first player can only be descending while the second player can only be ascending.

Observations:

1. the first player must start on a hill; if he did not then there's only one possible move for him to do and the second player can block him and win.
2. the number of steps he can do to left and right must be equal; if it is not then the second player can place himself appropriately on the longest of the branches and win.
3. both left and right branch must have even lengths; for odd lengths the second player places himself on the bottom of one of the branches and wins, regardless if the first player goes along the same branch or chooses the other one.
4. there cannot be another monotone sequence of equal or longer length than the ones at the starting point we're considering, as then the second player just starts there and have at least as many steps as we do and win.

This last observation in particular means that the answer will always be $$0$$ or $$1$$.  It's fairly easy to find the unique winning starting point (if it exists).
