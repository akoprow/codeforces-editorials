Count all elements by their remainder modulo $$m$$.  All elements with remainder $$0$$ must go to a group on their own.  Then we can group together $$i$$ and $$m-i$$, interleaving those two groups but be careful because:

- we can use one more from one group than the other,
- when $$i$$ and $$m-i$$ are the same we can put them all in one group.
