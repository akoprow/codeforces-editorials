Clearly, whatever we insert between any two elements will not affect any other pair so we can solve each pair independently.  For a given pair $$a_i, a_{i+1}$$ let's take $$x = min(a_i, a_{i+1})$$ and $$y = max(a_i, a_{i+1})$$.  If $$2*x \ge y$$ then we're good.  Otherwise, we want to insert $$2x, 4x, 8x, \ldots$$ and we can figure out how many of those elements we need with a simple loop.
