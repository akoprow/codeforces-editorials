The problem can be seen as having to map all letters in $$t$$ to equal letters in $$s$$ (in the same order), in such a way that the gap between some two letters in $$s$$ is as large as possible.  Firstly, for every $$i$$ let's compute $$mx_i$$ and $$mn_i$$ which are maximal and minimal, respectively, indices in $$s$$ that we can match it with.  Once we have that then clearly the answer is just $$max_{i \in 1..m-1} mn_{i+1}-mn_i$$.

How do we compute them?  For $$mn_i$$ a simple greedy approach works where we iterate over $$t$$ and move a pointer over $$s$$, matching it as soon as we can.  $$mx_i$$ can be done in the same way, except matching greedily from the back.
