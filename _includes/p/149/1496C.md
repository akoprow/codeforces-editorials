Firstly, observe that we can transform each $$(x, y)$$ point to $$(\mid x \mid, \mid y \mid)$$ without affecting the answer.  So now we're playing on a single positive quadrant of the coordinate system and it's easy to see (or prove from triangle inequality) that the optimal solution is to avoid lines intersecting and so to greedily sort all $$x$$ and $$y$$ coordinates and match them in that order.
