We pretty much just do what the problem describes, via a recursion with three arguments: $$(l, r, d)$$ being the segment we still operate on $$[l, r]$$ and current depth $$d$$.  We start with $$(1, n, 0)$$.  At a recursion step we find maximum in $$a_l, \ldots, a_r$$ at position $$p$$.  We denote $$d$$ as the answer for $$a_p$$ and we recursively descend into $$(l, p-1, d+1)$$ and $$(p+1, r, d+1)$$.
