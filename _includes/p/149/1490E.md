Let's sort players by the number of tokens they have.  Note that problem speaks about possibility of winning so if we just find one scenario where we win that's good enough for there to be a non-zero probability that this will actually happen, so that's good enough.

Firstly note that we can win with all the players that have not more tokens than we do and by doing so collect their tokens.  So we want to find the number of tokens that we need to have to win.  One option is by doing binary search.  Another is a more direct approach, which is linear after sorting and that's what I did; see code for details.
