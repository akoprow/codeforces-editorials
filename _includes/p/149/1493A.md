Firstly, we clearly cannot add $$k$$ itself and we can add anything larger than $$k$$ as by the virtue of being larger it can never help form a sum up to $$k$$.

The rest is greedy in spirit: we take decreasing number from $$k-1$$ for as long as we can and it turns out that we can go down to $$\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil$$ without getting a pair of numbers (and due to numbers being relatively large, hence, also more than two numbers) that adds to $$k$$.
