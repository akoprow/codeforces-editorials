Let $$x = mex(S)$$ and $$y = max(S)$$.

If $$x > y$$ then $$x = y+1$$ and $$\lceil \frac{x+y}{2} \rceil = \lceil \frac{2y+1}{2} \rceil = y+2$$, which means from now on we'll always be adding a new element in every step, so just bump the result by however many steps are left and we're done.

If $$x < y$$ then just compute $$\lceil \frac{x+y}{2} \rceil$$, add it to the set and continue simulating.  This cannot go on for more than $$n$$ steps at which point we'll start hitting the previous case, so the complexity is good enough.
