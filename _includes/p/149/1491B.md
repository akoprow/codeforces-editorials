Let's think about it geometrically , i.e. as if the obstacles where drawing a line (a pixelated one :).  To block us that line will need to:

- be uninterrupted (i.e. continuous) and
- it can either go to the left border of the board (cutting us off) or to the bottom border (splitting the board into two).

What does it mean for the line to be uninterrupted?  It means that for consecutive rows the difference in columns is at most $$1$$; otherwise we can "slip through".

When does it reach the left border?  When (uninterrupted) it reaches column $$0$$.

When does it reach the bottom border?  When (uninterrupted) it extends to the last row.

Now, if neither condition is true, we can pass without any changes.

If the line is a straight vertical line.  In this case we have two make two moves to move one obstacle out of the way: the first one to left/right and the second one either left/right or top/down, whichever is cheaper.

In the remaining cases it's always enough to move only one obstacle either up/down or left/right.
