Remember that to compute $$gcd$$ of a list of numbers we first find all the factors in those numbers and then for each factor pick the minimal power of that factor across all those numbers

$$a_1 = p_1^{\alpha_{1,1}}\cdot \ldots \cdot p_f^{\alpha_{1,f}},\ \ \ \ \ldots \ \ \ \ a_n = p_1^{\alpha_{n,1}}\cdot \ldots \cdot p_f^{\alpha_{n,f}}$$

$$gcd(a_1, \ldots a_n) = p_1^{min(\alpha_{1,1}, \ldots \alpha_{n,1})} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_f^{min(\alpha_{1,f}, \ldots \alpha_{n,f})}$$

So now we want to keep track of two things:

- for every position in the array a map of all the factors and their powers of the element at that position and
- globally, for every factor, a multiset of their powers across all elements in the array.

It's easy to initialize it at the beginning and it's also easy to compute initial $$gcd$$ based on the above formula.

Now for every query we do the following:

- factorize given $$x = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_v^{\alpha_v}$$.
- for every factor $$p_i$$ replacing mapping $$p_i \to \beta_i$$ with $$p_i \to \beta_i + \alpha_i$$, i.e. increase the respective power for that factor, for the $$i$$'th element in the array.
- in global multisets, for $$p_i$$, remove the old value of $$\beta_i$$ and instead add $$\beta_i + \alpha_i$$.
- if by doing so (in the last step) the minimal element in the multiset changed from $$mn_{old}$$ to $$mn_{new}$$, update the global $$gcd$$ by multiplying it by $$p_i^{mn_{new} - mn_{old}}$$
