Firstly, if we start jumping at trampoline $$i$$, this will not affect any trampolines to the left of it.  Imagine there is an "unfinished" (value other than $$1$$) trampoline to the left.  We will have to jump starting from it, so we might as well start there, as jumping from $$i$$ and then from $$j$$ is at least as good, and potentially better!,  as jumping from $$j$$ and then from $$i$$ ($$j > i$$).

So a greedy approach works: always start from the leftmost "unfinished" trampoline.

How do we simulate it?  For each trampoline keep track of how many times it was reached previously (starting with all $$0$$); let's call it $$d_i$$.  When we consider position $$i$$:

- we need to start afresh on it $$max(0, a_i - 1 - d_i)$$ times and we need to add that value to the final result.
- we will jump on it when it has values: $$a_i, a_i-1, \ldots, 2$$ which means we need to increment $$d_{i+2}, \ldots d_{i + a_i}$$ (as long as they are within bounds)
- we will jump on it $$min(0, d_i - (a_i -1))$$ with it having value $$1$$, which is by how much we should increment $$d_{i+1}$$.

Amazingly, the source code to this problem is at most half the size of this text...
