Firstly, clearly both axis are independent (and controlled by even/odd $$c_i$$) so we can kinda decompose into two subproblems.

If we had to use all $$c_i$$ then the optimal strategy is fairly clear:

- make minimal number of steps possible, i.e. $$1$$, for all "turns" but the one with minimal $$c_i$$,
- and then make all the remaining steps for the cheapest (applicable) $$c_i$$.

However, we do not have to use all $$c_i$$; we might do with just a prefix.  It's fairly easy to scan from $$2$$ to $$n$$ and at each point compute in constant time what the cost would be if we were to use only that many $$c_i$$.  Then just pick the best option.
