# **1457B** [Repainting Street](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/B)

With so few colors we can try them one by one and pick the cheapest.  So we know what color we want the street to be, how much is it going to cost to paint it so?  Well, we do a linear scan, skip over all houses of the right color and upon finding a wrong one, increment the score by $$1$$ and skip over the following $$k$$ houses (as we'll paint them all).
