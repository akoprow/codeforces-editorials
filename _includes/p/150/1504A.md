We cannot just try inserting "a" at every position and checking if we get a palindrome as that will TLE.  However, note that we can just try inserting at the beginning and at the end.  If neither works then there's no solution.  Why?   Since $$a\vec{x}$$ is a palindrome and $$\vec{x}a$$ is a palindrome then clearly $$\vec{v}$$ starts and ends with an $$a$$ and in fact is just a sequence of $$a$$ so clearly inserting $$a$$ anything into it will not give us a palindrome.
