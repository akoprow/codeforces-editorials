Let's compute frequency for all the numbers.  Clearly, in every step we can decrement two of those numbers and so we will only be left with one being non-zero and we want to minimize its value.  The optimal strategy is to greedily pair two most frequent numbers.  In fact, let's say the most frequent element occurs $$m$$ times.  Then we can match it $$n - m$$ times and so in the end we will be left with $$max(0, m - (n - m))$$ of its copies.  Except for when the number of elements is odd, in which case we will only be left with at least $$1$$ element unmatched.
