For each letter we need to leave just one (any) copy of it.  Firstly let's build for each letter a lists of positions at which it occurs.  Now we will build $$t$$ by looking at all the indices of last occurrences for all the letters and taking minimum over them, let's call that $$p$$.  As it's the last occurrence of some letter, we eventually need to use it, unless we use one of it earlier occurrences.  The candidates for the next letter in $$t$$ are all the letters that are not yet in $$t$$ and occur in the first $$p$$ characters of $$s$$.  We want lexicographically largest solution so let's pick the largest candidate.  Once we pick it we cannot use that letter any more and from all the list of indices for all the letters we can remove the ones that are smaller or equal to $$p$$, then continue until we distributed all the letters.
