The key observation here was that a brute-force looking like $$O(n^2)$$ is actually good enough.

The solution is as follows:

- see if there are $$4$$ copies of any element, if so they clearly form a solution; if not, ignore duplicates.
- keep a map from value to two indices whose elements sum up to that value.
- we're ignoring duplicates so if we find another pair we clearly found a solution.

Actually, this does NOT work... but passed all the tests... interesting ;)
