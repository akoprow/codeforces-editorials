We should start fixing from the end, as if some suffix is good we don't need to touch it ever again.  So we go from the end of the string and keep track of:

- a flag indicating whether we flipped the prefix and
- number of $$0$$s and $$1$$s in the prefix.

If at current position we get something else than what we need (after taking into account that prefix might have been flipped) then we need to flip that prefix.  So if number of $$0$$s and $$1$$s is different then there's no solution.  Otherwise we flip the "prefix-flipped" flag and continue.  Regardless of whether the current position matches or not we also update number of $$0/1$$ in the prefix.
