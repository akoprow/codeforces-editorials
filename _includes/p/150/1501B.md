It was possible to do it with some observations and simple operations, however an easy way out was just to use a Fenwick tree and directly simulate the process: 

- start with all layers being $$0$$,
- every time cream is poured on some lawyers just increase the respective range by $$1$$,
- at the end every layer which is greater than $$0$$ has some cream on it.
