This essentially just requires following the instructions in the problem.  Let's note by $$\mathcal{A}_i$$ the arrival time at station $$i$$ and by $$\mathcal{D}_i$$ departure time.  Then we have:

- $$\mathcal{A}_i = \mathcal{D}_{i-1} + a_i - b_{i-1} + tm_i$$ and
- $$\mathcal{D}_i = max(b_i, \mathcal{A}_i  + \lceil \frac{b_i - a_i}{2} \rceil)$$.

We need to report $$\mathcal{A}_n$$.
