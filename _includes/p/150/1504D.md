Let's think of the grid as a chessboard with alternating black and white squares.  Firstly let's fill one black and one white square with any, but different, numbers.  We can always do that as:

- in the first move, for the black square, we have two numbers to choose from and either works; say we end up with $$x$$
- in the second move, for the white square, one number is forbidden, one we potentially cannot use because we used it on black but one number remains; say it's $$y$$.

From there on we just continue filling black with $$x$$ and white squares with $$y$$.  At some point we will have filled all black (or white) squares but at this point we can put any number on white (black) other than $$x$$ ($$y$$).  Again we can always do that as we cannot use $$x$$ and we cannot use whatever Alice forbids us to, but one option always remains.
