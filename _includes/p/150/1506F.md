Since all arrows point downwards the only possible path is by visiting them in the increasing order of layers.  So what's left is to know how to compute the cost of moving between two given coordinates.

My thinking was to introduce a notion of a "line" where the first one contains $$(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), \ldots$$, the second one $$(2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), \ldots$$ etc. (see notes for clarification).  So coordinate $$(x, y)$$ is in line $$x-y$$.

Now suppose we want to go from $$(x_1, y_1)$$ to $$(x_2, y_2)$$.

- If they are in the same line, then we can move for free if it's an odd line (as all arrows go the way we want them) or for $$x_2 - x_1$$ otherwise (as we need to flip all the arrows between them).
- If they are on different lines then the answer is the number of times we need to go from odd to even line, as we can do all the necessary travelling "down-right" on some odd line on the way.
