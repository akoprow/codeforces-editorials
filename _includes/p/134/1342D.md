Firstly, one can see that the answer is at least:

$$max_{i \in 1..k} \lceil \frac{f(i)}{c_i} \rceil$$

where $$f(i)$$ is the number of elements in $$m_1, \ldots m_n$$ that are greater or equal than $$i$$.  This lower bound is fairly obvious from the problem constraints and it turns out that we can always construct an answer that is exactly equal to that simply by sorting the input array and then assign elements to appropriate number of slots (formula above) one by one.
