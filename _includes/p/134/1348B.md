For the array to be beautiful it must be $$k$$-periodic.  We collect all the numbers in $$a$$.  If there are more than $$k$$ different numbers in it then clearly the answer is $$-1$$.  Otherwise we take numbers from $$a$$ one by one and put $$k-1$$ $$1$$s in between them to ensure the result is $$k$$-periodic.
