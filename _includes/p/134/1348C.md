We sort the input and check if first and $$k$$-th letter are equal.  If they are not then the $$k$$-th letter is the answer, as that means there is a smaller letter before it and it makes sense to append all the remaining letters to it as it will still be lexicographically smaller than the $$k$$-th letter on its own.  Otherwise, if $$k$$ first letters are the same then we have two cases: if all the remaining letters are the same then we distribute them equally; if they are not then it is optimal to attach all of them to a single pile and that is the answer.
