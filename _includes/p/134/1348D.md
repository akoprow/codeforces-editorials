Let's think about the total growth from day to day.  If we had $$x$$ bacteria then during the night the mass will increase to something between $$x+1$$ and $$2x$$.  So the problem can be reworded as finding the shortest increasing sequence that sums up to $$n$$ and consecutive elements are at most doubled.  A possible construction is to double the value is every step until reaching $$n$$ -- so possibly the last element will be smaller.  It's enough to put that element in its right place (i.e. to maintain the property that the array is sorted).  All the constraints will be satisfied and it's fairly easy to convince oneself that this is the shortest possible sequence.
