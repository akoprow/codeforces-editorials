Let's denote by $$f(l, r)$$ the answer for segment $$[l, r]$$.

Firstly, observe that using prefix-sums-like idea we have $$f(l, r) = g(r) - g(l-1)$$ where $$g(x)$$ is the answer for segment $$[0, x]$$.

Secondly, observe that clearly this property is cyclic with a cycle length of $$a\times b$$, simply because $$pab + q \mod a = q \mod a$$ and same for $$b$$.

That means we can just pre-compute $$g(x)$$ for $$x \in [0, a\times b)$$ and having that we can answer each query in $$O(1)$$ as:

$$g(x) = g(ab-1) \frac{x}{ab} + g(x\mod ab)$$
