What happens in the first step?  All $$count_i$$ are $$1$$ and so we choose arbitrary position for $$1$$.  What next?  The counts will be $$1, 1, \ldots, 0, 2, 1, \ldots 1$$ and we will be forced to fill indices after $$1$$ one by one until the end of the array.  Then we will repeat the process on the prefix of the array with remaining numbers.  Overall that means that we need to check if $$p_i$$ consist of a series of sequences increasing by 1.
