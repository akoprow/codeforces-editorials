Think about a single row and a number of black blocks.  If there are $$2$$ or more blocks then the answer is $$-1$$ because there must be a magnet in that row; it's either to the left or right of the white block; we can get to both black blocks and so we can also get to the white block, so no solution.

So all rows/columns must have $$0$$ or $$1$$ blocks.  Suppose we have a row with no blacks; then we must also have a column with no blacks so that we can put the magnet on their intersection.  In other words there's a row with no black iff there's a column with no blacks.

If those two conditions are met then we just place a single magnet per every connected component using a flood algorithm.

I was struggling for a very long time with TLE because I made a silly mistake in the flood algo....
