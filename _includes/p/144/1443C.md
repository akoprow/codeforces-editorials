Fairly straightforward binary search. Answer must lie somewhere within $$[1, max_i{a_i}]$$.  To check whether we can be ready in time $$t$$ first filter out all dishes for which restaurant delivers on time and for the remaining ones we need to ensure that sum of their times when we pick up ourselves is not greater than $$t$$.
