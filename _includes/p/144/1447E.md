Ok, first let's think topology. There are $$n$$ edges. Two of them coincide (between two smallest numbers which both point to each other). So no cycles, we get a forest and all we need to do is to make sure it's connected.

So let's try to answer the following question: from the given number how many can we maximally take while having them form a tree?  Let's call this $$R(S)$$.

Let's take the higest bit in any of the numbers and split numbers into sets that have it set and those that don't, $$S_1$$ and $$S_0$$, respectively and so $$R(S) = R(S_0, S_1)$$.

If either set is empty then we just recurse solving for the other one: $$R(\emptyset, T) = R(T)$$.

If one set has just one element then we need to make sure the other set is valid and that single element will have to connect to __something__ so all is good.

Finally what if both have at least two elements?  Well, then clearly there will be a disconnect as all elements from $$S_1$$ will connect within themselves and similarly for $$S_0$$.  So we need to decrease size of either to $$1$$.
Combining those last two cases we get: $$R(S_0, S_1) = 1 + max(R(S_0), R(S_1))$$.
