This gave me so much grief!!  I thought that we just keep track of the mask of flipped positions for the last two rows and do a complete search with that.  But I got __completely__ bogged down with implementation and ended up with TLE...

Actually the crucial (non-trivial?) observation is that we can flip **any** even number of cells.  Once you see that it's just a matter of sorting all the cells and considering flipping all pairs from lowest numbers upwards.

To prove that take arbitrary two cells and notice that we can "move" from one to the other with a series of overlapping moves.  Because of overlaps only first and last cell in such a domino will be flipped. Repeat for all other pairs.
