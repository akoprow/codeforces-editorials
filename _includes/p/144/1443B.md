Compute: number of clusters of $$1$$s, let's call it $$p$$ and $$d_i$$ distances between all clusters.  Without planting any new mines we can solve it for a total cost of $$p * a$$.  Now sort all $$d_i$$ in increasing order and see whether it pays off to merge blocks: we have to pay $$d_i * b$$ for merging them but save $$a$$ as we'll get one fewer cluster.
