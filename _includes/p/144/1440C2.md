This is similar except now we don't have the luxury to be wasteful with the last row/column for odd sizes.

First let's solve for only one dimension being odd and let's assume it's the number of columns (for rows it's symmetrical).

We will be sweeping from left to right and in each step fixing 2 cells.  I.e. we're considering:  $$\begin{pmatrix}a & c \\ b & d \end{pmatrix}$$ and want to zero $$a$$ and $$b$$, which we can easily do. Once we reach the final $$2\times2$$ block we zero it completely as before.

Finally we're left with both sizes being odd.  Firstly we look at the bottom-right cell and if it's zero we fix it by flipping it (and whatever else).  Then we apply the algorithm from the previous paragraph for rows.  Finally we're left with the last row which can have some $$1$$s (except for the last column).  We look at it in $$2\times2$$ blocks with the previous row, which is all $$0$$s and so each block can have at most $$2$$ ones and so according to the initial calculation takes at most $$2$$ steps to fix.
