My solution: numbers' $$gcd$$ cannot be $$1$$ so the numbers must have a common factor; the smallest we can pick is $$2$$.  So start with $$2$$, loop through all numbers up to $$4n$$ and greedily see if we can pick $$n$$ numbers that are not divisible but any smallest picked ones.  If $$2$$ does not work (as it won't, especially for larger $$n$$), repeat the whole process starting at $$4$$ etc.

Simpler solution: just pick $$4n, 4n-2, 4n-4, \ldots, 2n+2$$.
