Let's first focus on a single $$2\times2$$ grid and look at the number of ones.  If there are none we are done.  If there is $$1$$ we can make $$2$$ or $$4$$.  If there are $$2$$ we can make $$1$$ or $$3$$ and if there are $$3$$ we can make $$0$$ or $$2$$.  Those form the following chain:  $$4 \to 1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 0$$.  So from any configuration we can get to $$0$$ in at most $$4$$ steps thus fixing $$4$$ grid positions.
What if the grid is not of even size?  We have enough moves to overlap those with preceeding rows/columns and still be well within the limit.
