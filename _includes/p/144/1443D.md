Find all local minima, $$l$$, and maxima, $$h$$. For every pair of minima-maxima $$(l_i, h_i)$$ we note $$h_i - l_i$$ which is the amount by which we'll need to lower all the subsequent elements.  We keep on adding those deltas and if at any point this goes below a $$l_i$$ that we consider then the answer is "NO".
