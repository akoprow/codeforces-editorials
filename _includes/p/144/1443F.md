Let's look at $$b_i$$, find it in the array $$a$$ and look at both of its neighbours: $$l$$ and $$r$$.  We have the following cases:

* if both $$l$$ and $$r$$ belong to $$b$$ then the construction is not possible as either of them needs to be removed but it will be needed for a later operation.

* if neither of them belongs to $$b$$ then we have the freedom of which one we'll pick as index $$t_i$$, hence we multiply the overall answer by $$2$$ and proceed.

* if only one of them belong to $$b$$ then we have to pick the other one as the index; we don't modify the answer and proceed.

So in the end the answer is either $$0$$ or a power of $$2$$.
