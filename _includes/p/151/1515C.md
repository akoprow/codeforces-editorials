We can sort towers in decreasing order and make a construction where at each step we add the current block to the smallest tower.  Since all elements are bound by $$x$$ we can easily see that with this construction the difference between highest and smallest tower will also be bound by $$x$$.  To implement it we can store current towers in a priority queue.
