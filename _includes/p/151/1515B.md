There are two possible squares to be used as building squares for the construction: one combining $$2$$ triangles and the other one $$4$$ triangles.  Both were shown in the initial test cases.

Now we can combine those basic building blocks by putting an arbitrary number of them on a grid hence getting $$x \times x$$ grid for any $$x$$.

Combined, this means that we can make a construction if $$n = 2x^2$$ or $$n = 4x^2$$ for some integer $$x$$.
