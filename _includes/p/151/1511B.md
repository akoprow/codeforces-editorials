Since $$10 = 2 \cdot 5$$ we have that $$10^i = 2^i \cdot 5^i$$.  So let's take $$x = 100\ldots 0 \cdot 10^{c-1}$$ and $$y = 111\ldots 1 \cdot 10^{c-1}$$. We have $$gcd(x, y) = 10^{c-1}$$ since $$10^i$$ and $$11\ldots1$$ are relatively prime.  So we can prepend the prefix of required length to both $$x$$ and $$y$$ and we're done.
