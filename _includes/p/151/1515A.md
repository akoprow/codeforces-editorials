If the overall sum is $$x$$ then whatever we do in the last step we'll get $$x$$ and so there's no answer.

Otherwise, we can just keep on adding weights in arbitrary order and if the next one would cause the running sum to be exactly $$x$$ then we can just swap it with the following element.  Since all elements are distinct this is bound to lead to a solution.
