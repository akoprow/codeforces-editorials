Firstly, let's remove pairs that we can match without any changes.  We can do that with two pointers traversing lists of left/right socks sorted by color.

Now, suppose we have more left than right socks (otherwise, swap them).  Whatever we do we'll need to turn $$\frac{l-r}{2}$$ left socks into right socks.  To do so is best to do it in pairs of left socks with matching colors so that after turning one of them into a right sock we have a matching pair.

Once we have no more matching socks, we just turn the required number of left socks into right and then change their colors to match with right socks.
