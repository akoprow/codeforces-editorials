This basically comes down to a single observation.  Let's say we consider a segment $$[l, r]$$.  What can we say about a segment $$[p, q]$$ that does **not** intersect it?  Well, it's either:

- $$p > r$$ or
- $$q < l$$ and
- crucially, it cannot be both.

So we can just form an array of all beginnings of segments (sorted) and all endings (sorted) and use them with a binary search to quickly compute for a given $$[l, r]$$ segment how many segments it does not intersect (we will need to remove that many to form an answer).  Now we just pick the best answer over all initial segments and we're done.
