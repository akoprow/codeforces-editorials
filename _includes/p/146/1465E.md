Crucial observation is that the last digit will always come with a plus sign, the last but one with a minus and *all the others we can choose however we like*.

Let's prove it.  Firstly, we can drop an arbitrary prefix of minuses by splitting on a single prefix character required number of times.  So we are left with a target of the form: $$+ \ldots +[---]-+$$ (part in the brackets can be empty or can have more minuses).  We split it by taking all but one minuses from the last segment of minuses into the right part, i.e. left: $$+ \ldots +-$$, right: $$[---]+$$.  Note that the left part is taken with a minus sign so we flip the targets and get left: $$- \ldots -+$$, right: $$[---]+$$, so we obtain two smaller segments so our thesis follows by induction.

Now knowing that we update target based on the last two digits and for the rest we apply a greedy approach: we sort digits in descending orders and apply each one in turn with the sign that will bring us closer to the target.
