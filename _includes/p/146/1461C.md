Let's find the longest suffix which already has its numbers in the right place, let's say the suffix is $$p, p+1, \ldots n$$.  This means that any experiment with $$r_i \ge p$$ will do.  We can easily compute the probability that all such experiments will fail: $$\prod_{j, r_j \ge p} (1 - r_i)$$ and so the answer we're looking for is $$1$$ minus that product.
