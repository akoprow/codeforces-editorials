Given the ridiculously low limit on $$x$$ it was possible to just precompute all solutions by a naive brute-force.

If we want to solve it "properly" then a number of observations:

- Zeroes are useless (they increase the number but do not increase the sum)
- Numbers should go in increasing order (order does not matter for the sum but smaller digits on more significant positions will lead to a smaller number)
- We can check what's the minimal number of digits by considering a prefix of $$987654321$$ until reaching (or exceeding) the required sum.
- If we found some answer in the following step then we optionally need to decrease it by the difference between its sum and the required sum.  That difference will always be at most $$8$$ and it's always optimal to decrease the initial $$9$$.
