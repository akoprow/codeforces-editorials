One option is to match the prefix with "2020" and similarly the suffix (in reverse).  If the sum of those matched substrings is at least $$4$$ then it means that the answer is positive.

Alternatively we can observe that we need to end up with a $$4$$ characters string, which means that we need to delete $$n-4$$ contiguous characters.  There are at most 5 ways to pick them and we can try them all and check whether what's left matches "2020".  In other words for $$(x, y)$$ we take $$x$$ character prefix and $$y$$ character suffix and we do that for: $$(0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)$$.
