Note that we repeatedly fire $$6$$ shots at whatever we want and then the following $$3$$ at all of the monsters.  That means that we can pass the dungeon beautifully if and only if:

* sum of monster strengths is divisible by $$9$$ and
* strength of each monster is at least $$(a+b+c)/9$$ (so that it does not die before we're done)
