Note that a prefix of $$a$$ will contain some prefix of $$r$$ and some prefix of $$b$$.  We can choose those prefixes independently and we want to maximize their sum; then we can reconstruct $$a$$ by first placing chosen elements from $$r$$ then chosen elements from $$b$$ and then all the rest in arbitrary order.  So simply iterate through $$r$$ (and then $$b$$) and pick the largest prefix sum.
