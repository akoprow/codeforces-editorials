Note that our operations essentially mean that we can collapse a block of contiguous elements into one equal to the sum of elements we collapsed.  And after doing that all elements must be equal.  Which means we must find blocks that can be collapsed to the required sum.

We know what's the required sum.  Let's say we know the solution ends up with $$k$$ blocks.  Then each block must have a sum of: $$\frac{\sum_i a_i}{k}$$ since all operations preserve the total sum.  If that number is not an integer then clearly such $$k$$ cannot work.  If it is then it remains to be checked greedily whether we can find blocks summing up to that value.

All that remains to be done is to check all $$k$$ in decreasing order from $$n$$ (no operations at all) to $$1$$ (everything collapsed to a single element, which is always a valid answer).
