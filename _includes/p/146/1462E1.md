Let's say the minimum number in a triple we consider is $$k$$.  Let's denote by $$n_{eq}$$ the number of elements $$a_i = k$$ and by $$n_{gt}$$ the number of elements in $$a_i \in \{k+1, k+2\}$$.

We have the following options for the formation of the triple:

- all elements equal to $$k$$; there are $${n_{eq}}\choose{3}$$ such configurations.
- two elements equal to $$k$$, one greater; there are $${n_{eq}\choose{2}} \cdot n_{gt}$$ such configurations.
- one element equal to $$k$$, two greater; there are $$n_{eq} \cdot {n_{gt}\choose{2}}$$ such configurations.

We now need to sum those values over all possible $$k$$s and we're done.
