Think of the operations as a rooted tree.  Nodes are the numbers in the bags. The root is the final number.  A directed edge from one number to the other indicates that we merge those numbers.  Each edge must necessarily connect nodes from different bags.

What's the total score?  With each layer of the tree we subtract numbers, so we actually end up switch between subtracting/adding them layer by layer.  That means that the final score is the sum of all elements at odd layers minus the sum of all layers at even layers.  So our goal is to put as little as possible into odd layers.  

A picture is worth a thousand words and the notes have two pictures of the optimal configurations but it comes down to either of those two options, where we manage to pack everything into odd layers except for:

- one element from one bag and one element from a *different* bag or
- all elements from a single bag (split between two layers)

Once we know all that it's very easy to compute those options and pick a better one.
