Intuition: the set of valid $$x$$ forms a contiguous segment.

To compute the left border we start from number $$1$$, iterate upwards and calculate the number of elements in $$b$$ vs not in $$b$$.  We take the largest difference between the two.  More formally:

$$l = max_{i \in 1..n} max(0, 2*\mid b_i \cap \{1, \ldots i\} \mid - i)$$

Similarly for right border except we go from $$2n$$ down to $$1$$.

$$r = max_{i \in 1..n} max(0, 2*\mid b_i \cap \{n, n-1, \ldots n-i+1\} \mid - i)$$

The final answer is the length of the segment, i.e. $$r-l+1$$.
