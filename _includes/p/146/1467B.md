First observation is that changes are very local, changing $$a_i$$ might change hill/valley status of elements at positions $$i-1, i, i+1$$ only.

Secondly, it's always optimal to change $$a_i$$ to either $$a_{i-1}$$ or $$a_{i+1}$$. To see that assume that we picked $$x$$ to minimize the number of hills/valleys in $$a_{i-1}, x, a_{i+1}$$.  We have two options:

- if $$x < max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1})$$ then we can change $$x$$ to be $$min(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1})$$, which ensures that there's no peak/valley at that position.
- or $$x > min(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1})$$ in which case we change it to $$max(a_{i-1}, a_{i+1})$$, again ensuring it does not form a peak/valley.

Once we know all that it's enough to compute the number of peaks/valleys in the original configuration and then try all those local modifications, efficiently compute updated score and pick the minimal one.
