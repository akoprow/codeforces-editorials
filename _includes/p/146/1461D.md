Observe that the result of a slicing operation does not depend on the order so we start by sorting the input array.

Then we will precalculate all $$i$$ such that it's possible to pass the $$i$$'th prettiness test.  For that we explore all possible slicings.  A state is a pair $$[l, r]$$ describing the section of the array that we are considering right now.  We get its sum cheaply by having prefix sums on the original array and add that value to our set of reachable $$i$$'s.  Then we compute $$mid$$, just by looking at first and last elements in the segment.  Finally we find the slicing point using binary search and continue recursively with at most two intervals that we generated.

Once we have this set answering the queries is trivial, we just check if the queried $$i$$ belongs to out set.
