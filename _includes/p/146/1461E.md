We have two cases.

Easier one is $$x >= y$$.  This means that we'll be constantly loosing water, by $$x-y$$ each day, except possibly the first one when it might be $$x$$ if adding $$y$$ would take us over $$r$$.  All we need to do is check if we can last $$t$$ days.  Careful with overflows!

Now if $$y > x$$ then we can refill lost water each day and the only question is whether we can stay within $$[l, r]$$.  We check iteratively, in each step going as many days as we can without refill and only then refilling and continuing.

Just doing so would be too slow given very high limits.  However, observe that if we reach a water level that we've seen in earlier iteration that means we can loop it and the answer is definitely "YES".  So we keep track of seen levels.  Notice further that those seen configuration are bound by $$x$$ as each configuration will have a different value modulo $$x$$.
