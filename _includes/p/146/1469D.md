The idea is that if we're solving segment $$[1, x]$$ then for $$x = 2$$ we're done and otherwise we want to:

- pick the largest $$y$$ such that we can use it to get $$x$$ to $$1$$ in two divisions,
- start by decreasing to $$1$$ everything from $$y+1$$ to $$x-1$$ by division on $$x$$,
- divide $$x$$ by $$y$$ twice to get it to $$1$$,
- continue recursively with segment $$[1, x]$$.

By doing so we're only spending one extra division (on $$x$$) and we're going from $$[1, x]$$ to $$[1, \sqrt{x}]$$, which is plenty enough to solve this problem.
