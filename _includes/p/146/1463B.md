One option is for each $$b_i$$ to take power of $$2$$ that is closest to $$a_i$$.  Hence at every position we're at most by factor of $$2$$ away from $$a_i$$ and so are we for the whole sum.  Since all elements are powers of $$2$$ we're also satisfying the condition of divisibility.

Another option is to consider $$(a_1, 1, a_3, 1, a_5 \ldots)$$ and $$(1, a_2, 1, a_4, 1 \ldots)$$; one of them is guaranteed to be the right answer.  Divisibility condition is trivially satisfied for both.  Denote by $$S_{odd}$$ and $$S_{even}$$ the sum of elements at odd/even positions in $$a$$.  $$S_{odd} + S_{even} = S$$ and so either $$S_{odd} \le \frac{S}{2}$$ or $$S_{even} \le \frac{S}{2}$$.  Assume it's the former.  Then we pick $$(1, a_2, 1, a_4, 1 \ldots)$$ for $$b$$ and it's easy to see that $$\sum_{i \in 1..n} \mid a_i - b_i \mid \le S_{odd}$$ and so $$2 \sum_{i \in 1..n} \mid a_i - b_i \mid \le S$$. // check
