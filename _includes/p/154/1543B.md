It's fairly easy to see that the optimal arrangement is to make the traffic on all tracks as evenly distributed as possible.  Let's denote by $$S = \sum_i a_i$$.  If $$S \mod n = 0$$ then we can make the traffic exactly equal on all tracks and the answer is $$0$$.  Otherwise, we'll have $$S \mod n$$ tracks that have traffic greater by one than the other $$n - (S \mod n)$$ tracks.  Those two classes of tracks are the only ones that contribute to the answer, each one contributes $$1$$ for a total of$$(S \mod n) \cdot (n - (S \mod n))$$.
