This is a problem for understanding of a DFS in directed graphs.  Let's do the usual thing of keeping state for each vertex while doing the DFS which can be either:

- `UNVISITED` if we have not reached the vertex yet (this is initial state for all vertices),
- `IN_PROGRESS` when we started but not yet finished processing the vertex, i.e. we're still exploring it's subgraph and
- `FINISHED` when we're done with the vertex.

Now we will do a DFS with a single source at vertex $$1$$.  We have few observations:

- if we reach a vertex that is in `IN_PROGRESS` state then we've just found a cycle and that vertex is part of that cycle.
- if we reach a vertex that is in `FINISHED` state then we've just found an alternative path to that vertex.

Let's denote the former set of vertices as $$\mathcal{C}$$ and the latter as $$\mathcal{A}$$.  We then extend $$\mathcal{C}$$ to $$\mathcal{\overline{C}}$$ by adding to it all the vertices that are reachable from any vertex in $$\mathcal{C}$$ (that's another DFS). Similarly we extend $$\mathcal{A}$$ to $$\mathcal{\overline{A}}$$.

Finally we have:

- if vertex $$v$$ was never reached by the initial DFS then it's unreachable from the initial vertex and we answer $$0$$ for it.
- otherwise, if $$v \in \mathcal{\overline{C}}$$ then there are infinitely many paths to it so we answer $$-1$$.
- otherwise, if $$v \in \mathcal{\overline{A}}$$ then there is more than one path to it so we answer $$2$$.
- otherwise, there's a single path only and we answer $$1$$.
