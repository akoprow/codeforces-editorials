We will build our target sequence element by element and at every step pick the smallest value we possibly can, so that it will be lexicographically smallest by construction.  Let's keep a running prefix-or $$p$$, i.e. the bitwise or of all the elements we've considered so far.  This tells us which bits must be set in the final sequence at this position.  So now we can take $$y_i := p \oplus x_i$$ so that $$x_i \oplus y_i$$ will have the required bit sets (and only those, as that will minimize $$y_i$$).
