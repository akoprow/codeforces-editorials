First simple observation is understanding what do the moves mean.  Essentially we need to have two adjacent pawns and we can move them (both together) to the left or right (provided that position is empty).

A more difficult observation is that the only things that matter are:

- the number of disjoint groups of pawns $$g$$ (i.e. $$5$$ pawns in a row give us two groups) and
- the number of empty positions $$e$$.

That is because we can move from any such configuration to any other such configuration. So the final answer is $${g+e}\choose{g}$$.

`TODO`: This is very hand-wave'y; understand better and improve this description.
