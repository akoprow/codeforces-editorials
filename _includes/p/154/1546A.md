Let's build lists of indices that need to be increased/decreased by 1.  So if $$a_i > b_i$$ then insert entry $$i$$ into the decrement list $$a_i-b_i$$ times and similarly for $$a_i < b_i$$.  Now, if those two lists have different lengths then clearly there is no solution.  Otherwise, just pair them up into operations (zip) and we're done.
