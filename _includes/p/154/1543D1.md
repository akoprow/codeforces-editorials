We have $$n$$ guesses and $$n$$ possible passwords; is there a way for us to try all options one by one?  The problem is that after each guess the password changes... but we do know *how* it changes.  If the password was $$pass_{old}$$ and we guessed $$guess$$ then it changes to $$pass_{new}$$ such that: $$pass_{old} \oplus pass_{new} = guess$$, i.e. $$pass_{new} = pass_{old} \oplus guess$$.  So after $$i$$ guesses we have: $$pass_{new} = pass_{old} \oplus guess_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus guess_i$$.  We can maintain $$p = guess_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus guess_i$$ and in the i'th query we can check if the original password was $$i$$ by querying for $$i \oplus p$$.
