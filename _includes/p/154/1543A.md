Firstly, if $$a = b$$ then we can gen infinite result by continuing to increment them both. Otherwise, without loss of generality assume $$a > b$$.  Note that $$a - b$$, let's denote it by $$d$$, does not change under the operations.  Also, we have $$gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, a - b) = gcd(a, d)$$ so the answer is bound by $$d$$.  And we can always get $$d$$ as we can always decrease $$(a, b)$$ down to $$(d, 0)$$.  However, we might be able to do it in fewer moves as it's enough to move $$a$$ -- either up, or down -- to any multiple of $$d$$.
