A simple constructive approach works: let's find "a" as the first index (if it does not exist or if multiple copies exist then the answer is clearly "NO").  From here on in every step we try to extend our index range to left or right depending on which side has the next letter we need.  Every step is uniquely determined and at every step if we cannot make a move or have multiple options for a move then the answer is "NO".  If we go through all the required letters and process the whole string then it's a "YES".
