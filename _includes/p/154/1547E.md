Let's calculate two arrays: $$L$$ and $$R$$ where $$L$$ (resp. $$R$$) is the temperature in each cell if each air conditioner only "works to the left" (resp. right).  This can be done with a single pass, keeping track of current temperature $$t$$ and when moving to the new cell we have: $$p := min(p+1, A)$$ where $$A$$ is the temperature generated by the air conditioner in that cell (or $$\infty$$ if there is none).  Note that we can reuse the same code for the second variant only pass in reversed inputs and reverse the output it generates.  Then we get final temperature in each cell simply as $$min(L_i, R_i)$$.
