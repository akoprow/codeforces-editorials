Without the obstacle the answer would be: $$\mid x_A - x_B \mid + \mid y_A - y_B \mid$$.  Notice that if both the height and weight of the rectangle implied by the start and end points is at least $$2$$ then the obstacle does not make a difference as we can walk around it.  In fact the only case when it does make a difference is when we're travelling in a straight line (either horizontally or vertically) and the obstacle is on our way, in which case we need extra $$2$$ moves to walk around it.
