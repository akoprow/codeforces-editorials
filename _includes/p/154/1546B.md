Let's reconstruct the stolen string index by index.  For any given position let's count the frequencies of all letters.  Note that letters will appear in pairs: once from the list of original strings and once from the scrambled up strings (but we do not care about the order) and only the stolen string's letter will contribute once without a pair.  So we can keep track of parities and the only letter occurring odd number of times is from the stolen string.

Alternatively, we can keep a multiset of letters (again, per index) and add all the ones from the original string and then remove the ones from the paired up strings.  The only letter remaining is from the secret string.

Yet another approach is to xor the letters together.  All pairs will cancel each other out and we will be left with the secret letter.
