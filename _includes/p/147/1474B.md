To have at least four divisors $$a$$ must be either a product of two primes $$d = p \cdot q$$, giving four divisors: $$1, p, q, p \cdot q$$, or $$d = p^3$$ with divisors: $$1, p, p^2, p^3$$.

For the first case all those divisors need to be at least $$d$$ apart, the simplest way to find them is for $$p$$ to start from $$d+1$$ and pick for it the first prime encountered and, similarly, for $$q$$ to pick the first prime greater than or equal to $$p+d$$.

We can prove that it's enough to consider only the first case as the second one would lead to a larger $$d$$.
