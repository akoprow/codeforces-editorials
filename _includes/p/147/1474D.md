Let's first solve it without using the superability. Since piles that were not neighbours do not get connected when removing another pile, the only way to get rid of the first pile is by removing it together with the second pile, which is only possible if $$a_1 \le a_2$$, in which case we're left with $$a_2-a_1, a_3, \ldots, a_n$$ and we can repeat that reasoning.  By repeating this process for every position $$i$$ we can compute $$l_i$$ which is the number of stones left on that position after removing all the piles to the left (or undefined is it's not possible to remove them).  We can do a similar process from right to left and compute $$r_i$$.  Now, if $$l_n = 0$$ then we're done without having to use superability.

Otherwise, we need to see if it can help us.  To do that for all adjacent indices we can consider swapping them.  That means that we're looking at: $$l_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, r_{i+3}$$ (provided $$l_i$$ and $$r_{i+3}$$ are defined) and we swap them into: $$l_i, a_{i+2}, a_{i+1}, r_{i+3}$$.  Now it's just a simple simulation to see whether we can solve that configuration.

If for all indices we cannot then the final answer is NO.
