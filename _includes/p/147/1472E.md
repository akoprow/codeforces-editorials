We can solve one condition at a time, i.e. separately assuming that the two people will be standing and assuming that the person in front will be lying and pick the better.

For standing we can sort people by height.  Now if we're looking at person of height $$h$$ let's find that person in the array (binary search).  Clearly all the people to the left are smaller and we just want to find the person with smallest width. To do that efficiently we can separately precompute minimal height on every prefix.

The other case is done the same, except we flip height-weights.

The tricky bit is to implement it correctly and without repetition (WIP).
