Firstly note that we always have a choice for every position in $$a$$ ($$0$$ or $$1$$), which in turn will always lead to a choice for a digit in $$d$$.  That means we can make all the digits in $$d$$ different and hence make $$d$$ of maximum possible length $$n$$.  So now it comes down to greedily making digits in $$d$$ as large as possible from left to right which we can do by choosing $$1$$ for a digit of $$a$$ if possible and $$0$$ otherwise.
