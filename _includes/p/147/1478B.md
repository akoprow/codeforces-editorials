Firstly, if given number $$v$$ itself contains digit $$d$$ then it itself is the answer.

Otherwise, if $$v \ge 10\cdot d + d$$ then we can always represent it as:

- $$v_1 = 10 \cdot d + (l \mod 10)$$ and
- $$v_2 = d + (l - (l \mod 10))$$ where $$l = x - 10\cdot d - d$$

Note that:

- $$l \ge 0$$ because of our initial assumption.
- $$d$$ is the second least significant digit in $$v_1$$, so $$v_1$$ is lucky.
- $$d$$ is the least significant digit in $$v_2$$, so $$v_2$$ is lucky.
- $$v_1 + v_2 = 10 \cdot d + (l \mod 10) + d + (l - (l \mod 10)) = v$$.
- hence $$v_1$$ and $$v_2$$ are a valid solution.

Otherwise, our only bet is to put together a number of $$d$$s (which are obviously lucky) and see whether what remains has $$d$$ as least significant digit (hence is also lucky).  Since we only care about values modulo $$d$$ they will quickly start cycling so we only need to consider taking between $$1$$ and $$9$$ copies of $$d$$.

TODO: Prove/argue why otherwise the answer is no.
