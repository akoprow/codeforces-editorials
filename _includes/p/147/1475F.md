Few observations.

* Order of operations does not matter (because xor is commutative)
* It does not make sense to apply the same operation twice (as it then will cancel itself out)

One way to think about it is that going from $$a$$ to $$b$$ is equivalent to going to a matrix of all zeroes from a matrix $$c$$ where $$c_{i,j} = [a_{i,j} \neq b_{i,j}]$$ (i.e. $$1$$ if given cells in both matrices are different, $$0$ otherwise).  So matrix $$c$$ essentially tells us which cells we need to flip (to zero them).

Now, we will now say that columns $$i$$ and $$j$$ are compatible if either:

* for each row $$p$$, $$c_{p,i} = c_{p,i}$$ or
* for each row $$p$$, $$a_{p,i} \neq c_{p,i}$$.

In the first case those columns are already equal, in the second case we can make them equal by applying xor to either of the columns.

Now, let's check if all columns are compatible with the first one.  If they are we can make all rows identical.  And if we have all rows identical it's a win, we just flip all those column which are all $$1$$ and get a matrix full of zeroes.

Otherwise, we cannot make all rows equal by applying row operations and so column operations will not help us because there will always be at least one column with some $$0$$ and some $$1$$ and then that will remain so after applying an operation to it.
