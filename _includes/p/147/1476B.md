We want:

$$\frac{p_i}{p_0 + \ldots + p_{i-1}} \le \frac{k}{100}$$

or, equivalently:

$$100 \cdot p_i \le k \cdot (p_0 + \ldots + p_{i-1})$$

We compute that by keeping track of the running sum.  If at any point the equation does not hold we compute the delta by which we need to increase the running sum, i.e.:

$$\lceil \frac{100 \cdot p_i - k \cdot (p_0 + \ldots + p_{i-1}}{k} \rceil$$

we update the running sum and continue further.  The sum of all the deltas is our answer.
