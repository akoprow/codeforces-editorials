For a fair division to exist two conditions must hold:

- sum of candy weights must be divisible by $$2$$ (if it's not then clearly we cannot split it evenly) and
- either:
  - the sum is divisible by $$4$$, in which case the amount each kid should receive is divisible by $$2$$ and so clearly we can get that value without $$2$$s getting in the way OR
  - there must exist at least two candies weighting $$1$$, in which case we give one each to each kid and we're back in the case where what we need to give them is even.
