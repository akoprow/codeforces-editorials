The dimensions are independent and if we can cut horizontally into $$c_h$$ pieces and vertically into $$c_v$$ pieces then the answer is $$c_h \cdot c_v$$.

How to compute for a single dimension?  Well, the answer is the highest power of $$2$$ that divides the dimension and so we can keep on dividing by $$2$$ for as long as possible.
