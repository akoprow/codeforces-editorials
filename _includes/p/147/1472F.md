It all comes down to analysing all the consecutive columns at which something is blocked.  We have three configurations depending on which of the two rows are blocked:

- both-blocked,
- upper-blocked,
- lower-blocked.

If both cells are empty we will need to fill them with a vertical block so it will fall into the first case.  Transitions are as follows:

- From both-blocked, we move to the next configuration whatever it is (we can simply fill the space in between with vertical blocks)
- From upper-blocked if the next is:
  * upper-blocked: we might end up in both blocked (filling in a zig-zag fashion) or conclude it's impossible, depending on the pairty of the distance between those columns
  * lower-blocked: similar, except parities are reversed
  * both-blocked: there's no way to fill that so it's game over.
- From lower-blocked transitions are analogous to upper-blocked.
