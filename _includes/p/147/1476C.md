It's clear that the cycle's right side will be one of the chains.  So we'll iterate over that chain, $$i$$, and will keep track of the current longest cycle that we can built to the left of $$i$$, let's call that $$q_i$$.  To simplify things, notice that we can swap $$a_i$$ and $$b_i$$ without influencing the result, so let's normalize it so that always $$a_i < b_i$$.

We have two cases.  If $$a_i = b_i$$ then the current chain is connected to the same vertex so $$q_i = 2$$ as we can only use the two links to that vertex.

Otherwise we have two options (a picture is worth a thousand words so see notes for a diagram)

- either we follow the links to the previous chain and then follow that chain, that gives us $$2 + b_i - a_i$$ or
- we follow the links and then combine it with the longest cycle so far for $$2 + q_{i-1} + (a_i - 1) + (c_{i-1} - b_i)$$.

We combine those two options for the final formula:

$$q_i = 2 + max(b_i - a_i, q_{i-1} + (a_i - 1) + (c_{i-1} - b_i))$$

Now at each position we close the cycle so need to add the path traversed along the last chain so the final answer is $$max_i (q_i + c_i - 1)$$.
