We essentially simulate what the robot does by passing through the array, only instead of adding new elements to the array we keep a total sum of its elements and we keep track of the divisor which is $$x$$ initially and gets multiplied by $$x$$ after each iteration.  If we process an element we add it to the total result (even though it'll be added in several chunks they will all sum up to its original value).  And once we reach an element that stops being divisible we stop.
