Surprisingly difficult for Div III A, me thinks!

Problem limits are too large to check all divisors of numbers.  So we need to do better than that.  Let's think about factorization of a given number $$x$$:

$$x = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdot \ldots p_n^{\alpha_n}$$

If any of the factors is odd then clearly $$x$$ is divisible by an odd factor.  Now, the only prime number that isn't odd is $$2$$ itself.  So the only number $$x$$ that does not have an odd divisor is if $$x = 2^i$$ for some $$i$$.

So we only need to check if $$x$$ is a power of $$2$$; either naively, or, if we want to be fancy, by checking if $$x \& (x-1) = 0$$.
