Firstly, let's sort the input array.  Now for each number $$x$$ we will want to see how many numbers smaller than $$x$$ we can put together with $$x$$ to form a beautiful array.  We keep track of a mapping from a number to that value, let's call that $$f$$, and when seeing $$x$$ update mapping for $$x$$ to:

$$ \max_{d \in \mathcal{D}(x)} f(d)+1 $$

where $$\mathcal{D}{x}$$ is a set of all divisors of $$x$$.  In other words we go through all divisors of $$d$$ (those are all numbers that can be with $$x$$ in a beautiful array) and pick the best one, adding $$1$$ because we extend the sequence with $$x$$.

To do that we need to efficiently iterate through all divisors of any number and we do that by precomputing all divisors of all numbers up to $$2 \cdot 10^5$$ using the sieve of Eratosthenes.

I actually had a lot of problems avoiding TLE on this problem with Kotlin.
