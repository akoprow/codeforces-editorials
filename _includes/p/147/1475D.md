Let's split applications into two groups: one with $$b_i = 1$$ (normal) and the other with $$b_i = 2$$ (important).  For each group let's take the application size in decreasing order and compute prefix sums.

We will iterate over $$x$$, indicating how many elements we take from the normal group, from $$0$$ up to all the elements in the group.  We compute how much size will that free us up which is the sum of the first $$x$$ elements.  Based on that we compute how much more space we need to free up with important applications.  We find the number of important applications we need to remove, $$y$$, using binary search.

Having those two we know that we will loose $$2y+x$$ convenience points and we pick the minimum one.

Actually, instead of binary search we can use two pointers as as we take more and more of normal applications, we will always be decreasing the number of important applications.  So we don't even need prefix sums, just two pointers over those two arrays.
