We can iterate over pairs $$(a_i, b_i)$$ and for each one we can add:

$$k - F_a(a_i) - F_b(b_i) - 1$$

where $$F_v(x)$$ is the number of $$x$$ within vector $$v$$.  In other words:

- we take $$(a_i, b_i)$$ as the first pair,
- out of the k-1 remaining pairs how many are there that *cannot* complement the first pair?  Well, all the ones with boy $$a_i$$ in it (as he's taken) and all the ones with girl $$b_i$$ (she's also taken).  Note that there is only one pair $$(a_i, b_i)$$ so all the other pairs excluded because of the girl and because of the boy are disjoint, which is why the formula works.
