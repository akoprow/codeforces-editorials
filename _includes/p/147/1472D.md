Clearly Alice wants to take large even numbers, but then Bob will be taking large odd numbers so Alice might be better off preventing that.  So faced with the choice of picking even $$x$$ or odd $$y$$, which one should she go for?  $$x$$ gives her $$x$$ points but $$y$$ gives Bob $$y$$ points so she should just pick the greater.  Which means everyone just goes for largest available number.  From here on it's just a matter of sorting the input and doing a simple simulation.
