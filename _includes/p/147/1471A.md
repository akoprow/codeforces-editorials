If all numbers are divisible by $$x$$ then it doesn't matter how many operations we will perform, they will never affect the result.  Otherwise they could and it is not too difficult to see that if we want to minimize the result then it's best to collapse everything into a single number in which case the answer is:

$$\lceil \frac{\sum_i a_i}{x} \rceil$$

and to maximize it it's best not too do any operations for the result of:

$$\sum_i \lceil \frac{a_i}{x} \rceil$$

The reason for that is because for any $$a, b, x$$ we have:

$$\lceil \frac{a+b}{x} \rceil \le \lceil \frac{a}{x} \rceil + \lceil \frac{b}{x} \rceil$$
