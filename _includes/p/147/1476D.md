The crucial observation is that if we start at city $$i$$ and move to other city $$j$$, we can always come back to $$i$$.  We can easily see that that's possible after one step and we can prove it for arbitrary number of steps by induction (or just convince ourselves that it works by observing $$2$$ or $$3$$ steps).

So now for each city we compute $$L(i)$$ and $$L_rev(i)$$ denoting how many steps to the left can we move from city $$i$$ in initial/reversed setup (all arrows reversed), respectively.  We have $$L(i) = L_rev(i-1)+1$$ if $$s_{i-1} = "L"$$ and $$0$$ otherwise.  Similarly $$L_rev(i) = L(i-1) + 1$$ if $$s_{i-1} = "R"$$ and $$0$$ otherwise.

Now, we do the same for $$R(i)$$ and $$R_rev(i)$$ to compute our moves to the right.  And we combine it for each city by seeing how far we can go to the left and right, plus the city itself, giving us the final answer for city $$i$$ of: $$L_i + R_i + 1$$.
