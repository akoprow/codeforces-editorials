Observe that $$x$$ strictly decreases after each operation.  We should greedily in each step handle the largest element in the array.  Why?  Suppose at some step we did not.  That means we have $$a_i \le a_j \lt a_k$$ and we decide to throw $$a_i + a_j = x$$.  After that operation new $$x$$ becomes $$a_j \lt a_k$$ and so we'll never be able to get rid of $$a_k$$.

So we sort numbers and process them from the right. In the first step what do we process the largest element with?  Well, let's try all elements one by one.

Once we know what's the pairing we remove it, know what the next $$x$$ becomes and continue.  This requires an ordered multiset and leads to $$O(n^2 \log n)$$ complexity which was TLE-ing for me.

Another approach is to start from the largest element and keep track of a multiset $$\mathcal{M}$$ of paired elements that we haven't processed yet.  In each step, looking at $$a_i$$, we have two options:

- either the current element is in the multiset, in which case we remove it from it (essentially completing a past pairing or
- it is not, in which case
