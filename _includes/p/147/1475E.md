Clearly we must pick the bloggers with most followers.  So we can sort by the number of followers and choose the first $$k$$ of them.

The only leeway we have is when the last chosen blogger has $$x$$ followers and some not chosen bloggers also have $$x$$ followers; we can swap them and still have the maximum number of followers.  In other words all bloggers with $$x$$ followers are interchangeable for us.  Suppose there are $$k$$ such bloggers in the prefix we picked and $$n$$ in total in our pool of bloggers.  Well clearly the number of ways in which we can choose them is $${n}\choose{k}$$.
