We essentially have three cases:

- $$n \ge k$$ and $$n$$ is divisible by $$k$$ then the answer is $$1$$ as all elements equal to $$1$$ are a correct solution
- $$n \ge k$$ but $$n$$ not divisible by $$k$$ then the answer is $$2$$ as all $$1$$ is not divisible by $$k$$ and we need to bump up some elements to $$2$$.
- $$k < n$$ the answer is $$\lceil \frac{k}{n} \rceil$$ as we are aiming for the total sum to be $$k$$ in this case and that's the maximum we will need to put in a single element.
