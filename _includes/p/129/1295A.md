First observation is that digit $$1$$ is the only one using only two segments.  Since we want as many digits as possible we should just construct a stream of $$1$$s.  The only exception is if we start with an odd number of segment as this process would leave us with one segment unused but instead we can use it to change the leading $$1$$ into a $$7$$.
