It's not difficult to see that we cannot pass only if there's a blockage at some position $$i$$, which means that:

- cell $$(1, i)$$ has lava and
- either of the three cells: $$(2, i-1), (2, i), (2, i+1)$$ has lava.

So we can simply keep track of the board state and also the set of positions at which a blockage occurs.  We can quickly update it with each new query and also we can infer whether we can pass, which is whenever there is no blockage at all.
