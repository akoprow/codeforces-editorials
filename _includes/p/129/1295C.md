Greedy.  We keep track of our position in $$s$$ and the string and also for every letter keep a sorted set of positions where it occurs.  Then we do a sweep through $$t$$.  Once moving to the next letter we find its next occurrence in $$s$$ at a larger position than the current one and if that does not exist we increment the result by $$1$$ and move to the beginning of $$s$$.  If (and only if) some letter from $$t$$ does not occur at all in $$s$$ then it's impossible and we output $$-1$$.
