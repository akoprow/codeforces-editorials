The crucial observation is that the coordinates grow exponentially so there aren't that many nodes that we need to consider, $$100$$ is plenty enough.  We can generate their coordinates (the tricky part being that it won't fit in $$64$$-bits so we need to resort to using BigInteger).

The next observation is that the optimal solution will always involve going to some node and then going either left, or right, for as long as we can.  So at this point we can just simulate that and find the best answer.

Alternatively, to avoid using large integers, we can generate the points until we reach one that has largest $$x$$ and $$y$$ coordinates than our start node and is more than $$t$$ steps away from it.
