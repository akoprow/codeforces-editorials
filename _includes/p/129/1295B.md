Tricky! Firstly let's dispose of the easy case: if the total balance on the string, $$\mathcal{T}$$ is $$0$$ that means that in every iteration the values will not be changing and so either the answer is $$-1$$ (if we hit $$x$$ in a single iteration) or $$0$$ (if we do not).

If it's not $$0$$ then the key observation is that on every position we might hit $$x$$ at most once.  It helps to visualize this as a discreet function on $$[1, n]$$; in every iteration we move this function by $$\mathcal{T}$$ so clearly if we hit $$x$$ on a position we only do it once.  Now what's left is to figure out if we hit it for every position.  To do that we take $$v$$ as the balance on the string up to the given position and check if:

- $$(x-v) \mod \mathcal{T} = 0$$ and
- $$(x-v) / \mathcal{T} \ge 0$$.

The former is that there's a "round" in which we'll hit $$x$$; the latter is to make sure that it's "in the right direction" (think of us wanting to hit $$-5$$ by getting $$+1$$ added after every cycle).
