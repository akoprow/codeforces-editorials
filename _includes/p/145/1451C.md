Firstly, note that the order does not matter as we can swap however we like.  Sort target and build frequency map for the source and start matching in order.  If the smallest available character in the source is greater than what we match against  answer NO.  If it's the same, just match.  If it's smaller try to promote $$k$$ smallest characters and continue with the matching.
