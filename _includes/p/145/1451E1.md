I did not finish within contest time.  The crucial observation is that if we know at least one number we can get to know all the remaining ones with one move per number.  Say we know what $$a$$ is and want to reveal the following $$b$$.  We ask for its $$xor$$ with $$a$$: $$a \oplus b = p$$.  Then $$a \oplus a \oplus b = a \oplus p$$ and so $$b = a \oplus p$$.

The second observation is that we can solve it in a boolean algebra and then just do it bit-by-bit for full numbers.

How to find some number?  First, observe that just querying two numbers is hopless, due to symmetry of all the operations.  If we instead look at $$3$$ numbers we can use $$5$$ queries for them and it turns out that asking any distinct $$5$$ queries involving and/or gives us the answer, which can be verified by exploring truth tables for $$3$$ boolean variables.
