Given this was an `A` and the large limits, it was possible to just guess that the answer is the length of the input number.  But why?

Well, it's not difficult to see that for $$g(x)$$ we are diving the input number by itself with all the leading zeros dropped, as that's what $$f(f(x))$$ does.  Which means $$g(x) = 10^i$$ where $$i \in 0 .. (s-1)$$, where $$s$$ is the length of the input number (as a string).
