It's (_relatively_, sigh) easy to see that the answer must be $$-1$$ or $$1$$, since if we merge something from a given point, everything merges into that point and no further merging is possible.

So it's enough to just check if there exist a point from which all the others are within the given distance and if so answer $$1$$; otherwise it's $$-1$$.
