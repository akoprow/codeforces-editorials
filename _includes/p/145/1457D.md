Let's group numbers into groups based on their highest bit.  If we have any group with at least $$3$$ numbers, say $$(a, b, c)$$, in it then the answer is $$1$$ as in one step we transform them into $$(a, b \oplus c)$$ and $$b \oplus c$$ is smaller than $$a$$ as it does not have that highest bit set, whereas $$a$$ does.

If there is no such group then we have just a handful of numbers; at most $$2$$ per bit for a total of $$60$$ or less. We want to get $$(a, b)$$ with $$a > b$$.  Note that $$a$$ is a xor of some contiguous segment until some point and $$b$$ is a xor from that point up to another point.  So we can just consider all combinations $$(l, m, r)$$ where $$a$$ is a xor of numbers from $$[l, m)$$ and $$b$$ of numbers from $$[m, r)$$.
