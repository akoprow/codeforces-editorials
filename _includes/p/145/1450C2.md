This is somewhat similar to the easier version except we will:

* pick one colour and change all its marks to $$X$$ and
* pick another colour and change all its marks to $$O$$s.

By construction this eliminates possibility of any winning combinations on the board.

If we pick the best pair we're also guaranteed to be within the limit of moves as:

$$X_R + X_G + X_B + O_R + O_G + O_B = k$$

Now, let us denote by $$f_{c_1 c_2}$$ the cost of flipping colour $$c_1$$ to $$X$$s and $$c_2$$ to $$O$$s, so: $$f_{c_1 c_2} = X_{c_1} + O_{c_2}$$.  Combining we obtain:

$$f_{RG} + f_{RB} + f_{GB} + f_{GR} + f_{BR} + f_{BG} = 2k$$

and hence:

$$min(f_{RG} + f_{RB} + f_{GB} + f_{GR} + f_{BR} + f_{BG}) = \lfloor \frac{k}{3} \rfloor$$
