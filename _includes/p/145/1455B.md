This is a tricky one.  Firstly, let's observe that by doing $$s$$ forward steps we will get to $$s (s+1) / 2$$ and we can always do that until we're past $$x$$ and then retract if needed.  However, that won't work even on a test case, as for $$4$$ we'd do $$1 + 2 + 3 - 1 - 1$$, i.e. $$5$$ steps, whereas we can do it in $$4$$: $$-1 + 2 + 3$$.

So we need to consider replacing one of the forward steps with $$-1$$.  If before we got to $$p$$ then by replacing $$k$$'th one with $$-1$$ we'll instead get to $$p - k - 1$$, so we can cover the range $$[p-s-1 .. p-2]$$. Since $$p-s<x$$, if $$x < p-1$$ we can do the fix with no extra moves!  Only for $$p = x+1$$ we need to corret with an extra $$-1$$ move.
