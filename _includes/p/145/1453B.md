Tricky beast.  Firstly, let's observe that our goal is to make all elements in the array equal to the first one.  That's because the only way to change that first element is by changing the whole array which, relatively speaking, does not change anything so is useless.

Let's first forget about the allowed single change and solve it for the initial array.  The optimal strategy is to sweep from left to right, fixing elements one by one.  Fixing each one costs us the absolute difference with the previous element, so the total cost is: $$\sum_{i \in 2..n} \mid a_i - a_{i-1} \mid$$.

Now, how much can we save from that cost by changing a single element?  We can either make the first element equal to the second one, hence saving $$\mid a_2 - a_1\mid$$ or make last two equal hence saving: $$\mid a_n - a_{n-1}\mid$$ or make element at position $$i$$ equal to its predecessor, saving: $$\mid a_i - a_{i-1} \mid + \mid a_{i+1} - a_{i} \mid - \mid a_{i+1} - a_{i-1} \mid$$ (for $$a, b, c$$ we don't have to go from $$a$$ to $$b$$ and from $$b$$ to $$c$$ but instead go directly from $$a$$ to $$c$$).
