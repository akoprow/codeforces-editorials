Tricky.  Firstly let's observe that for:

* $$k=1$$ we just need the input array to be a permutation
* $$k=n$$ it's enough that $$1 \in \vec{a}$$

What about other $$k$$? Let's think about $$k=n-1$$. Firstly, we need to have $$1$$ on either border of the array; otherwise we'll be stuck with two copies of it.  Secondly, we need the rest of the array to reduce to $$2$$ which means that $$2$$ must be a minimum of that subarray.

Moving on to $$k=n-2$$ we remove $$1$$ from either end of the array, check that $$2$$ is on either end and that the minimum is now $$3$$.

This process can easily be implemented with two pointers for beginning/end of the considered range and a multiset of elements that are left to be considered, to efficiently compute $$min$$ in each step.
