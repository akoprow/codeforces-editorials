Let's divide the board into 3-coloured, red-green-blue, squares, such that every winning triple of board positions always has one piece of each colour.  This can be easily achieved by using color $$(i + j) \mod 3$$ for board position $$(i, j)$$.

Now let's flip all $$X$$s of a single colour into $$O$$s, so by construction we will prevent any winning combinations.  Let's say that the number of $$X$$s of different colours is: $$X_R, X_G, X_B$$.  We have $$X_R + X_G + X_B = k$$ and so $$min(X_R, X_G, X_B) \le \lfloor \frac{k}{3} \rfloor$$.
