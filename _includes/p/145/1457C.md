With DP for every position we'll compute the cost of the level assuming that the given cell will be the $$p$$ cell of the level.  That's easy, for position $$i$$ it's just $$0$$ or $$x$$, when $$a_i = 1$$ or $$a_i = 0$$, respectively, plus already computed cost at $$i+k$$.

Once we have that we can iterate over all positions and consider cost of dropping the prefix plus cost of the suffix, precomputed as per above.
