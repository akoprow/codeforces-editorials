I got __hopelessly lost__ with this problem! In fact; it's about parities. First solve for all $$n \le 3$$.  For larger $$n$$ the answer is $$2$$ if $$n$$ is even: divide it by $$\frac{n}{2}$$ and then subtract $$1$$.  If $$n$$ is odd the answer is $$3$$: subtract $$1$$ and then continue with the solution for even.  I lost a lot of time on this problem and came up with something way more complicated.
