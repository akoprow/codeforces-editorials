Firstly, note that if both digits on a single card are the same then this card will not have any impact on the result and we may as well discard it.

After that all cards have different digits and so after permutation it will always be the first card that will decide the overall result.  So we simply look at all the cards and count cases where $$r_i > b_i$$ and where $$b_i > r_i$$ and compare those two numbers. If the former is larger than we answer "RED", if latter "BLUE" and if they are equal then "EQUAL".
