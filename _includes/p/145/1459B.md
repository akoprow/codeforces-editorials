Couple of observations.  Firstly, the move rules simply mean that we alternate moves between moving along X and along Y axis (starting with arbitrary).  Secondly, we can think of those two moves independently, as they affect different components of a $$(x, y)$$ coordinate.

We have two cases.  If $$n$$ is even that means we'll do $$k = n/2$$ moves of each type.  Each move modifies coordinate by $$+1$$ or $$-1$$.  What values we can reach on the axis we're considering?  Well: $$k, k-2, \ldots, 0, \ldots, -k+2, -k$$ and there are $$k+1$$ of them.  Since both axis are independent this gives an overall answer of $$(k+1)^2$$.

What if $$n$$ is odd?  We'll do $$k = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$$ moves along one axis and$$\lceil n/2 \rceil = k + 1$$ along the other axis and we can pick which is which.  For each of those choices we can use similar reasoning to the one from the previous paragraph and so we end up with $$(k+1)(k+2)$$ moves.

Now, configurations that we reach in those two cases are disjoint.  Why is that?  That's because each move changes parity of the values along each axis and so those parities cannot be the same after $$k$$ and $$k+1$$ moves.  That means that the total number of combinations in the odd case is: $$2(k+1)(k+2)$$.
