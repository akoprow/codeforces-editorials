We can consider each digit separately, so we basically have a grid of boolean values and we need to find a biggest triangle rooted at $$3$$ points out of which at least $$2$$ are $$true$$.

Note that the area of a triangle multiplied by $$2$$ (what we're asked) is simply the length of the base of the triangle times its height; and since the base is parallel to the axis this is easy to compute (and is an integer).

Let's say that we have a position in the matrix with the right digit at $$(i, j)$$ and we'll want to change digit at position $$(p, q)$$.  We have two cases to consider:

* $$i = p$$.  We want the base as long as possible so clearly we want to make $$j = 1$$ or $$j = n$$, whichever gets longer, making the length of the base $$max(j-1, n-j)$$.  What about the remaining third point?  The only thing that affects the computation is the row in which it will be and, since we want to maximize the height of the triangle, it's clear that we want to use $$r_min$$ or $$r_max$$ where those are the minimal, respectively maximal, rows where we have the right digit.

* $$j = q$$.  Similarly, $$p$$ will be either $$1$$ or $$n$$ and we'll want to pre-compute $$c_min$$ and $$c_max$$, i.e. minimal/maximal columns with the right digit.

Note that we do not need to think separately about the case where the changed point is not part of the base since it can always be moved so that it is, without changing the area of the resulting triangle.
