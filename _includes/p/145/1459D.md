Few observations at first.  Let's say we chose some $$k$$ glasses; what do we need to know about them to compute the final answer?  Two things only: total capacity and amount of water in them initially.  Why is that?  Well, the optimal pouring strategy is very simple: we keep water in those glasses and pour from all the others directly to them until reaching capacity.  Let's say that our $$k$$ glasses have $$W$$ water in them and a total capacity of $$C$$, whereas the total amount of water in all the glasses is $$W_{all}$$.  The final answer then is: $$min(C, W + (W_{all}-W)/2)$$, because we cannot go over total capacity $$C$$, we initially have $$W$$ water in the glasses and $$W_{all}-W$$ water available that we can pour, loosing half of it.

Once we know that we can device DP with state $$S_{(i,k,c)}$$ being initial amount of water in $$k$$ glasses chosen from glasses $$1..i$$ such that their overall capacity is $$c$$.  Knowing that we can relatively easily come up with the transitions as we have two cases for a glass: use it as one of the chosen glasses or not.

$$S_{(i,k,c)} = max(S_{(i-1,k,c)}, S_{(i-1,k-1,c-a_i)} + b_i)$$

Not strictly necessary but if we are careful and do the computations in the right order we can get rid of the first dimension $$i$$; see code for details.
