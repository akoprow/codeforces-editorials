I was counting the number of moves following the "diagonal" and answered based on its parity, without fully understanding why that works.

The reasoning instead is to find maximum $$z$$ such that point $$(kz, kz)$$ is within the circle.  Now if $$(kz, k(z+1))$$ is within the circle first player wins; otherwise he looses.

Why does he loose in the second case?  Because second player can always follow the diagonal and so at its end the first player has no move.

Why does he win in the first case?  There's a bit more math to it but we can show that it's equivalent to the first player's situation in the other case.
