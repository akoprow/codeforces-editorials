Firstly, observe that solving segments between two checkpoints is independent and so the total expected number of tries is a sum of expected tries over all segments.

Now let's call by $$F(i)$$ expected number of tries to solve $$i$$ levels between checkpoints. Clearly $$F(1) = 2$$.  For $$i=1$$ we need to solve all the preceding $$i-1$$ levels and then we will succeed half of the time, leading to: $$F(i) = 2*(F(i-1)+1)$$, so we have $$F(2) = 6, F(3) = 14$$ etc.

Now our problem basically comes down to expressing $$k$$ as a sum of $$F(i)$$ values. Clearly, if $$k$$ is odd then that is not possible. If it is even then it turns out that we can always do that.

One strategy is to do it greedily: generate $$F(i)$$ values for $$i=1..58$$ ($$F(58)$$ is larger than the largest possible $$k$$ we can get) and then greedily use largest value that is less than $$k$$, decrement $$k$$ and continue.  Turns out that in the worst case this will use $$1654$$ stages, though I did not even attempt to prove it during the contest.
