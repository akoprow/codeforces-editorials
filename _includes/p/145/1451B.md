Again, I came up with a sub-optimal solution.  I basically tried an exhaustive search.  Since we must match with a non-contiguous segment there must be an index at which point we do not match with a consecutive character.  So I tried all such split points exhaustively.

As a matter of fact solution is much simpler: we answer YES iff the first character is present somewhere before the segment _or_ the last character is present somewhere after the last segment.

It's clear that this is a sufficient condition as we can easily construct the right segment if it holds.  Why is it neccessary?  Assume that a segment exists but the above condition does not hold. First character does not occur before so our match cannot start before and last character does not occur after so our match must end with the end of the segment, so we're only left with the segment itself but that's not non-contiguous.
