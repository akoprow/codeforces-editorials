A cell $$(x, y)$$ is $$1$$ if and only if both $$a_x$$ and $$b_y$$ are $$1$$.  A rectangle $$[x_1 \ldots x_n][y_1 \ldots y_n]$$ consists of only ones if and only if both $$a[x_1 \ldots x_n]$$ and $$b[y_1 \ldots y_n]$$ consist of only $$1$$.

Let's denote by $$L(v, i)$$ the number of contiguous segments of length $$i$$ consisting of only $$1$$ in vector $$v$$.

Let's now look at all divisors of $$k$$.  Each divisor gives us $$k = p \cdot q$$.  Note that the number of rectangles with dimension $$p \times q$$ (which has area $$k$$) is $$L(a, p) \cdot L(b, q)$$.

How can we compute efficiently $$L$$ for $$a$$ and $$b$$?  We can easily do that in $$O(n^2)$$ time (which should be fine here) by finding longest segments of ones.  Each such segment of length $$k$$ has 1 segment of length $$k$$, 2 segments of length $$k-1$$ all the way down to $$k$$ segments of length $$1$$.

But we can also do it in $$O(n)$$ by only counting the longest segment seen so far, i.e. passing through three ones we will compute $$1 \to 1, 2 \to 1, 3 \to 1$$ but then we use prefix (suffix) sums and when we want to see how many segments of length $$l$$ there are we sum over $$l$$ and larger values in our counters.
