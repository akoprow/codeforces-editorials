Ok, so let's think about what we can do.  Let's say we set the first element to $$u$$.  What can we do now?  Firstly, if $$v$$ is smaller than $$u$$ then it's hopeless; we need $$u$$ for XOR and we can only add to it with more numbers.  In fact, while doing the adding, for every bit position we must have it set in the even number of remaining numbers so that we don't disturb our XOR established in $$u$$.  So let's look at $$d = v - u$$.  As already mentioned if it's negative then the answer is $$-1$$.  If first bit in $$d$$ is set then we won't be able to set it so the answer is $$-1$$ again.  Otherwise the answer exists and it's actually $$u, d, d$$.  We can see that $$u + 2*d = v$$; note that we rely here on the fact that $$v-u$$ is even.  And also $$u \oplus (d \oplus d) = u \oplus 0 = u$$.  But can we do better than three numbers?  If $$u \& d$$ is zero (i.e. they don't share any bits) then we can "pack" them into a single number: $$u \mid d$$ in which case $$u \mid d, d$$ is the answer.
