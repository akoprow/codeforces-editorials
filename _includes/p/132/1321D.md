Let's say we are about to go from $$u \to v$$ on our path.  What we want to know is if there's some other $$w$$ such that $$u \to w$$ and path from $$w \to t$$ is shorter or equal than path from $$v to t$$.  If it's shorter then our GPS would have to show that to us and so will have to reroute, hence it adds $$1$$ to both our minimal and maximal answers.  If it's equal then it *might* have to reroute so we only add $$1$$ to the maximal number of re-routings.

How do we efficiently calculate the shortest paths?  Well, we just do single source paths, starting from $$t$$ in the reversed graph.  Since it's an unweighted graph we don't even need Dijkstra or anything, we just do a BFS.
