Firstly, we only care for problems where both teams have different outcomes, as otherwise it has no impact on who wins.  Let's say that $$x$$ is the number of problems solved by us but not by the opponent and $$y$$ is the number of problems solved by them but not us.  If $$x = 0$$, there's no way we can win so output $$-1$$.  Otherwise, it clearly pays off to give $$1$$ point to each problem solved by the opponent.  Then problems solved by us need at most $$\lceil \frac{x+1}{y}\rceil$$ points, which is the answer.
