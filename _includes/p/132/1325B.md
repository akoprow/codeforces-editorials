The answer is the number of distinct elements in the initial sequence (before copying).  Why?  Well, the final sequence must be strictly increasing so clearly that's the upper bound.  And if we have some $$d \le n$$ distinct numbers then we can sort them and that will be a subsequence in $$n$$ copies as we can always pick the first element from the first copy, the second from the second one and so on.
