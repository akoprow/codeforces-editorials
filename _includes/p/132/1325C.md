Firstly, if the tree has an intersection with 3 edges, i.e. a node of degree 3 or more then we can label $$3$$ of those edges $$0, 1, 2$$ and the rest of the tree whatever and we get a tree with MEX $$2$$.  We cannot do better as there will always be a path passing through both $$0$$ and $$1$$.

Now, if the tree does not have such a node then it means that it's a flat list of nodes (a rope?) in which case the MEX will must be $$n-1$$.
