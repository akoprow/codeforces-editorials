Firstly observe that the skyscrapers will have to form a "house roof" shape: they will be going up in a non-decreasing way up to a point and then will be going down in a non-increasing way from there on.   Let's call the point in the middle "peak".

What if we knew where the pick is?  Then it's fairly easy, we just do a greedy approach going from the peak first to the left having two constraints, as each element has to be:

- at most $$a_i$$ and
- smaller or equal than whatever we decided to build immediately to the right of it.

Similarly, we go from the peak to the right.

Since $$n$$ is small we can just check all the possible placements for the peak and choose best.
