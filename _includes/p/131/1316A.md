Since we cannot change the average we cannot change the sum of all the grades.  So if we want to bring our own grade up by $$1$$ we need to decrease someone else's grade by $$1$$.  What's the maximum grade we can achieve with this strategy?  Well, it's $$sum_{i \in 1..n} a_i$$ as we can take all the points from all the other students and assign them to ourselves (at the same time they cannot go below $$0$$).  On the other hand the maximum we can get is $$m$$.  So the answer is simply $$min(m, \sum_{i \in 1..n} a_i)$$.
