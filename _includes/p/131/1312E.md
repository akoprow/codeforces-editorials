The problem outlines clearly what is a valid single move.  Let's note that each element in the final array will correspond to a collapsed segment of the initial array, such that together they give full coverage of the input array.

Let's denote by $$[i, j] \to v$$ the fact that we collapse segment $$[i, j]$$ to value $$v$$ (note taht if we can collapse a segment $$[i, j]$$ to a single element then the value of that element is uniquely determined).  How can we figure out if such collapsing is possible?  Segment $$[l, r] \to v+1$$ if and only if there is some $$m \in [l, r-1]$$ such that $$[l, m] \to v$$ and $$[m+1, r] \to v$$.

We can compute this for all segments by starting with trivial segments $$[i, i] \to a_i$$ and then do DP, iterating on the length of segments.  In this way in $$O(n^3)$$ we know for every segment whether we can collapse it and if so, to what value.

Now how can we compute the best coverage with such segments?  Let's denote by $$\mathcal{D}_i$$ the best coverage for the first $$i$$ indices in the array.  To compute it for an index $$i$$ we look at all the segments $$[l, i]$$, i.e. segments ending at $$i$$ and taking maximum of $$\mathcal{D}_l + 1$$ over them.
