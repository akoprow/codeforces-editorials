First let's solve it for $$k = 2$$.  It's clear that each bit $$i$$ can be set in at most one number of the whole set since then we'll be able to remove it when its turn comes and we're processing $$2^i$$.  For arbitrary $$k$$ solution is similar, except we need to change the base of all numbers to $$k$$.  If we get any digit that is greater than $$1$$ then the answer is "NO" as we'd need to apply the operation to it more than once.  Also if for any position we get more than one number with digit $$1$$ in it that's also a "NO".  Otherwise, it's a "YES".
