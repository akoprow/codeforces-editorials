Just by performing this operation for different $$k$$ it's easy to observe that the prefix of the result will be $$s_k s_{k+1} \ldots s_{k+(n-k+1)-1}$$ and the suffix will be:

- $$s_1 \ldots s_{k-1}$$ if $$n$$ and $$k$$ have the same parity and
- $$s_{k-1} \ldots s_1$$ if they have different parities.

From now on it's just a matter of generating all those options and picking the one lexicographically smallest (while being careful that for ties smaller $$k$$ wins).
