Let's look at coefficients of $$f(x)$$, i.e. $$a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1}$$.  Since we know that $$gcd(a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1}$$ is $$1$$ that means that there is some coefficient that is co-prime with $$p$$ (if there weren't that'd mean that all coefficients are divisible by $$p$$ and hence we'd have $$gcd(a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1}) \ge p$$).  Now, let $$a_i$$ be first of such coefficients, i.e. the one with smallest $$i$$ fulfilling this condition.

For the same reasons we must have $$b_j$$ in coefficients of $$g(x)$$ that is not divisible by $$p$$ with all $$b_0, \ldots b_{j-1}$$ divisible by $$p$$.

Now, let's look at $$i+j$$'th coefficient of $$h(x)$$, it is:

$$c_{i+j} = a_0 \cdot b_{i+j} + a_1 \cdot b_{i+j-1} + \ldots + a_{i-1} \cdot b_{j+1} + \underline{a_i \cdot b_j} + a_{i+1}\cdot b_{j-1} + \ldots + a_{i+j} \cdot b_0$$

The important observation is that all elements of the sum other than the underlined one are divisible by $$p$$.  The ones to the left of the underlined one are because $$a_0, \ldots a_{i-1}$$ are all divisible by $$p$$ and the ones to the right are divisible because all of $$b_0, \ldots b_{j-1}$$ are.  Since $$a_i \cdot b_j$$ itself is *not* divisible by $$p$$, hence the whole sum isn't and it is our answer.
