Solving this is a matter of looking at the constraints in the right way; for a given $$n$$ and $$m$$ we need to choose:

- $$n-1$$ distinct numbers from the available $$m$$; number of options: $$\binom{m}{n-1}$$
- one number that will be repeated, note that it cannot be the maximal one, so the number of options is: $$n-2$$
- note that 3 elements are fixed: the maximal one (the "peak") and two repeated ones (one of each side of the peak); all the other elements we can choose if they should go either to the left or to the right of max, so the number of options to do that is: $$2^{n-3}$$

Putting this all together we get the final formula:

$$\binom{m}{n-1} \cdot (n-2) \cdot 2^{n-3}$$
