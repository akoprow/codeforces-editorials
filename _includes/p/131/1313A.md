First important observation is that there are only 7 possible dish combos, if we call dishes $$A$$, $$B$$, $$C$$ we can have:

- $$A$$, $$B$$, $$C$$,
- $$A+B$$, $$A+C$$, $$B+C$$ and
- $$A+B+C$$.

It's also clear that the groups are in order of preferences, i.e. we should never start serving from a later group unless we already served all the dishes from all the previous groups.

The only tricky part is the second group, as we have to be careful here, if we have $$2A$$, $$B$$ and $$C$$ then we can pair them into $$A+B$$ and $$A+C$$, which means we cannot start by pairing $$B+C$$.  But we can easily solve that by considering $$A, B, C$$ in the order of abundance, starting from the one whose most copies we have.
