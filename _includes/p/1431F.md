Binary search over the answer, which must be in $$[0 .. \sum_i a_i]$$. For a given $$s$$ we must be able to answer whether it's possible to solve with a metric of at most $$s$$.

We can do that greedily.  Let's add elements one by one to a block.  If sum exceeds $$s$$ remove the largest element in the block so far.  If by doing so we run out of removals we can do, answer is no.  If block reaches size $$x$$ start a new block.
