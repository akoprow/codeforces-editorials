Boy oh boy, this gave me some grief.  I wrongly understood the exercise to forbid diagonal moves.  So let's solve that first.

It's clear that we want to move everything to center.  We can split the matrix into $$4$$ symmetrical quarters and solve independently (see attached drawing); let $$p = \lfloor{\frac{n}{2}}\rfloor$$

$$4 \sum_{x \in 0..p} \sum_{y \in 1..p} x + y =$$

$$4 \sum_{x \in 0..p} x p + p (p+1) / 2 =$$

$$4 p (p+1)^2 / 2 + 4p \sum_{x \in 0..p} x =$$

$$2p(p+1)^2 + 2p^2(p + 1)$$

Now let's go back to the original problem.  It's even simpler as every "ring" has the same distance to the center, so:

$$\sum_{x \in 1..p} i (4 \times 2i) =$$

$$8 \times \sum_{x \in 1..p} i^2 =$$

$$8 \times \sum_{x \in 1..p} i^2 =$$

$$\frac{4}{3} \times p(p + 1)(2p + 1)$$

Last transition by [Square pyramidial numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_pyramidal_number), which is not really needed, a loop would do.
