Think of s as a series of strings $$t_0, t_1, \ldots t_{k-1}$$ where each $$t_i$$ is formed of characters from $$s$$ whose index modulo $$k$$ is $$i$$.  Now, observe that all $$t_i$$ must be all $$0$$, except for possibly one which can be of the form

$$0\ldots01\ldots10\ldots 0$$, i.e. contain a single contiguous block of $$1$$.

Then answer is:

$$min_{i \in 0..k-1} fix(t_i) + onesIn(s) - onesIn(t)$$

where $$fix(s)$$ is the minimal number of moves to bring $$s$$ to the single-block-of-$$1$$ shape.

How to compute that quickly for a string $$s$$?  Denote by $$dp_i$$ the minimal score to make the first $$i$$ characters good and such that character $$i$$ is $$1$$.  Then at step $$i$$ we do:  $$dp_i = make(s_i, 1) + min(ones(s_{[0..i-1]}), dp_{i-1})$$ where $$make(s_i, 1)$$ is the cost of flipping $$s_i$$ to $$1$$ (either $$0$$ or $$1$$) and $$ones(s)$$ is the number of $$1$$ in $$s$$ (which we can compute efficiently using prefix sums).  Then the final answer is: $$min(ones(s), min_i dp_i + ones(s_{i+1..n}))$$
