[Codeforces Round \#687 (Div. 2, based on Technocup 2021 Elimination Round 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457)

# **A** [Prison Break](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/A)

`bruteforce` [Code](https://github.com/akoprow/competetive-programming/blob/master/src/codeforces/r680-699/r687/1457a-prison-break.kt)

It's pretty clear that the answer is the cell located furthest from the exit and it's not hard to see that it must be one of the 4 corners of the prison.

# **B** [Repainting Street](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/B)

`bruteforce` `greedy` [Code](https://github.com/akoprow/competetive-programming/blob/master/src/codeforces/r680-699/r687/1457b-repainting-street.kt)

With so few colors we can try them one by one and pick the cheapest.  So we know what color we want the street to be, how much is it going to cost to paint it so?  Well, we do a linear scan, skip over all houses of the right color and upon finding a wrong one, increment the score by $$1$$ and skip over the following $$k$$ houses (as we'll paint them all).

# **C** [Bouncing Ball](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/C)

`dp` `construction` [Code](https://github.com/akoprow/competetive-programming/blob/master/src/codeforces/r680-699/r687/1457c-bouncing-ball.kt)

With DP for every position we'll compute the cost if it will be the $$p$$ cell at the level.  That's easy, for position $$i$$ it's just $$0$$ or $$x$$, when $$a_i = 1$$ or $$a_i = 0$$, respectively, plus already computed cost at $$i+k$$.

Once we have that we can consider all possible suffixes, compute cost of dropping respective prefix plus the remaining cost precomputed above and just pick the best option.

# **D** [XOR-gun](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/D)

`construction` `xor` [Code](https://github.com/akoprow/competetive-programming/blob/master/src/codeforces/r680-699/r687/1457d-xor-gun.kt)
