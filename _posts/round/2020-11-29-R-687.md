[Codeforces Round \#687 (Div. 2, based on Technocup 2021 Elimination Round 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457)

# **A** [Prison Break](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/A)

`bruteforce` [Code](https://github.com/akoprow/competetive-programming/blob/master/src/codeforces/r680-699/r687/1457a-prison-break.kt)

It's pretty clear that the answer is the cell located furthest from the exit and it's not hard to see that it must be one of the 4 corners of the prison.

# **B** [Repainting Street](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/B)

`bruteforce` `greedy` [Code](https://github.com/akoprow/competetive-programming/blob/master/src/codeforces/r680-699/r687/1457b-repainting-street.kt)

With so few colors we can try them one by one and pick the cheapest.  So we know what color we want the street to be, how much is it going to cost to paint it so?  Well, we do a linear scan, skip over all houses of the right color and upon finding a wrong one, increment the score by $$1$$ and skip over the following $$k$$ houses (as we'll paint them all).

# **C** [Bouncing Ball](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/C)

`dp` `construction` [Code](https://github.com/akoprow/competetive-programming/blob/master/src/codeforces/r680-699/r687/1457c-bouncing-ball.kt)

With DP for every position we'll compute the cost of the level assuming that the given cell will be the $$p$$ cell of the level.  That's easy, for position $$i$$ it's just $$0$$ or $$x$$, when $$a_i = 1$$ or $$a_i = 0$$, respectively, plus already computed cost at $$i+k$$.

Once we have that we can iterate over all positions and consider cost of dropping the prefix plus cost of the suffix, precomputed as per above.

# **D** [XOR-gun](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/D)

`construction` `xor` [Code](https://github.com/akoprow/competetive-programming/blob/master/src/codeforces/r680-699/r687/1457d-xor-gun.kt)

Let's group numbers into groups based on their highest bit.  If we have any group with at least $$3$$ numbers, say $$(a, b, c)$$, in it then the answer is $$1$$ as in one step we transform them into $$(a, b \oplus c)$$ and $$b \oplus c$$ is smaller than $$a$$ as it does not have that highest bit set, whereas $$a$$ does.

If there is no such group then we have just a handful of numbers; at most $$2$$ per bit for a total of $$60$$ or less. We want to get $$(a, b)$$ with $$a > b$$.  Note that $$a$$ is a xor of some contiguous segment until some point and $$b$$ is a xor from that point up to another point.  So we can just consider all combinations $$(l, m, r)$$ where $$a$$ is a xor of numbers from $$[l, m)$$ and $$b$$ of numbers from $$[m, r)$$.
